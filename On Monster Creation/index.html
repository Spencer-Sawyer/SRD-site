<h1 id="on-monster-creation">On Monster Creation</h1>
<p>While the standard character-building system can be used to make most challenges, not everyone wants a campaign filled only with mostly humanoid sapient creatures as their only combat obstacles. Below the details on how monsters, dragons, animals, constructs and so, are created.</p>
<h2 id="terms">Terms</h2>
<p><strong>Natural Attack</strong>: Natural attacks are things like claws, fangs, wings, tails, ect. Typically a monster has a primary, often claws or a bite, that has the highest bonus. All other natural attacks are at a -5 bonus during a full round attack. On any full-round attack, a monster uses ALL of its natural attacks. If they cannot full-attack they will typically opt for their primary natural weapon. Weapon focus (Unarmed), and its counterpart feats, apply to all natural weapons.</p>
<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>
<p>Much like making a character, the first thing we need to do is pick a primary creature definition for the monster. Typically these should not be taken by players as they are intended for monstrous challenges. To make a monster strong enough to battle a team of adventurers they need to be a bit stronger in some ways than a player build. Unless specified in a monster entry creatures take secondary creature definitions as needed to fit what they are. </p>

<p><strong>HD Modifier</strong>: HD Override</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong>: Details</p>
<h2 id="animal">Animal</h2>
<p><em>Natural creatures born of nature and living happily, so long as they lack magical powers, most people would consider these animals. They range wildly in their capabilities, size, shape, and ferocity. This is the definition used to make an animal companion.</em></p>

Animals always gain 8 skill points at first level and 2 skill points every level thereafter, which can be applied to Balance, Climb, Hide, Jump, Move Silently, Search, and Swim.</p>
<h2 id="construct">Construct</h2>
