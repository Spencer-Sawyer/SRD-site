    <h2 id="attribute-damage">Attribute Damage</h2>
<p class=tab>
 Attribute damage takes points off the score of an attribute. If someone takes 4 points of Strength Damage, and had an 18 in strength. Their strength will temporarily be 14, which changes the modifier. Attribute damage is healed every day by a number equal to the affected person's constitution modifier. The modifier is used as a pool to heal multiple types of attribute damage. So if someone has lost 2 points of Dexterity, and 2 Points of Charisma, they would need a constitution modifier of 4 to heal both. The player can choose which attributes are healed. If a character has a zero or negative constitution modifier, they can recover 1 attribute point.
</p>

<h2 id="damage-reduction">Damage Reduction</h2>
<p class=tab>
Damage reduction is the equivalent of energy resistance but for the physical damage types. These types include Slashing, Piercing, Bludgeoning, and Crushing. Damage reduction is applied to all attacks in a round. If your character gets hit 5 times, they apply the damage reduction once for each hit.</p>
<p class=tab>Damage reduction is notated by the value reduced / what penetrates it. For example 15/silver will reduces 15 damage from every hit, unless it comes from a source made of silver. If the damage reduction is noted 5/- this will mitigate 5 damage from any physical source of damage.
</p>

<h2 id="delusion">Delusion</h2>
<p class=tab>
Delusions only affect the target creature(s). Anything that helps defend against mind-affecting spells also applies to delusions. Figments can fool the senses enough to make someone hurt themselves in the process of dealing with it.
</p>

<h2 id="difficult-terrain">Difficult Terrain</h2>
<p class=tab>
Sometimes an area is difficult to traverse for one of many reasons. In these areas a character moves at half speed.
</p>

<h2 id="disposition">Disposition</h2>
<p class=tab>
Disposition is the opinion and willingness of a character to listen to another character. There are a lot of skills that are affected by disposition. If someone likes you they are easier to convince, fool, or work with in general. If the skill is being used on an NPC the DM will silently add or subtract modifiers based on the NPCs disposition. See the chart below for how the bonuses work. If you are working to improve disposition with a character this is best done through in game action or by the DM setting an DC and applying the current disposition modifier.
</p>

<h2 id="exertion">Exertion</h2>
<p class=tab>
An exertion is a standard action that reduces the remaining duration of a spell or ability effect to an instantaneous duration. In turn there are often damage or other affects detailed in the entry. <a href="../../abilities/#energy-charge-su">Energy charge</a> is a good example of this.
</p>

<h2 id="figment">Figment</h2>
<p class=tab>
A figment is a type of illusion that creates an effect in the world that everyone can see. These types of illusions are not subject to anything that makes a person interacting with the figment immune to mind affecting spells. Figments can trick all of the sense, and are not just visual.   
</p>

<h2 id="holyunholy">Holy/Unholy</h2>
<p class=tab>
Anything that is holy/unholy will bypass any damage reduction of the corresponding type. Unholy things deal an extra 1d10 damage to living things while Holy will do the same for undead things.
</p>

<h2 id="known-spell">Known Spell</h2>
<p class=tab>
A known spell is a spell a character understand inherently and does not need to prepare it at the beginning of the day. It can be used in place of any prepared spell at any time, so long as they have spell slots remaining for the day. Any magic caster will have some known spells, characters with the wizardry primary definition gain an entire school of known spells.
</p>

<h2 id="line-of-effect">Line of Effect</h2>
<p class=tab>
Line of effect is a term used to describe when you would normally be able to affect something. You have line of effect to a creature if you could throw a ball at them and hit them. Please note, this does not mean a player or monster blocks line of effect, but a wall or large object would.
</p>

<h2 id="natural-attack-primary">Natural Attack, Primary</h2>
<p class=tab>
Natural attacks do not follow the standard attack for a weapon wielding characters. Instead a creature with natural attacks will have a number of attacks determined by the species or monster entry. It is possible to get natural attacks from spells. Primary natural attacks are done at the character's/creature's highest base attack bonus + strength modifier or dexterity modifier (whichever is higher) + any other bonuses they might have. If they have more than one primary attack, all of them are done at the highest attack bonus the character/creature has.
</p>

<h2 id="natural-attack-secondary">Natural Attack, Secondary</h2>
<p class=tab>
Secondary natural attacks are any non-primary special attack. They are at -5 from the highest base attack instead of being the full. Damage done by these attacks will deal a bit less as they can only apply half of the user's strength mod.
</p>

<h2 id="quick-gold-value">Quick Gold Value</h2>
<p class=tab>
If constantly giving unidentified items and keeping track of loot becomes too complex or time consuming, a DM can instead use a Quick Gold Value (QGV) and divide it among the party members instead. This value is determined by the value of the items divided by 2. DMs should vary this value some depending on how the battle went.
</p>

<h2 id="reach">Reach</h2>
<p class=tab>
Reach weapons are weapons that threaten another 5 ft. worth of squares around them for a medium size creature. A reach weapon with a small size creature minus the far corners.
</p>

<h2 id="rest-period">Rest Period</h2>
<p class=tab>
A rest period is any significant amount of down time in which a character and get at least 6 hours of sleep, meditation, preparation, or other types of down-time activities. If a character sleeps or meditates they will recover their HD x constitution modifier in HP as well as 1 point of attribute damage across all attributes. Spells Per Day, as well as the daily use of abilities will be restored, and items that might also have daily uses. During this time it is possible ti use the <a href="../../skills/heal/">heal</a> skill to multiply out the healing gained. The heal multiplier is applied to the attribute score damage (always round down) as well.
</p>

<h2 id="size-modifier">Size Modifier</h2>
<p class=tab>
Size modifiers are penalties or bonuses that apply whenever size is a deciding factor in a roll. Refer to the chart below for them. There are times when size helps or hinders. So both negatives and positives are included. In terms of AC the smaller the better, in terms of grappling or things where might is important being bigger is better.

<h2 id="spell-proficiency">Spell Proficiency</h2>
<p class=tab>
Spell proficiency is added to Spells, Spell-like abilities(Sp), Supernatural Abilities(Su) DC's; and any non-touch attack roll. It is also applied as a flat bonus for each damage/healing/warding dice for Spells, Spell-like abilities(Sp), or Supernatural Abilities(Su).
