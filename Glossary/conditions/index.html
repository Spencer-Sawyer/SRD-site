    <h1 id="conditions">Conditions</h1>
<p class=tab>Conditions are very temporary afflictions that belong in a category of their own, as they all auto-recover within a relatively short amount of time. Below is a list of all condition summaries.
</p>

<h2 id="bad-luck">Bad Luck</h2>
<p class=tab>
A creature can be affected by condition, typically given by fairies, called bad luck. This effects makes all damage rolls minimum for the duration.
</p>

<h2 id="dizzy">Dizzy</h2>
<p class=tab>
A dizzy creature must make concentration checks DC 10 + their HD + spell level to cast spells. When moving at a DC 15 balance check must be made or fall prone. To Run the DC becomes 25. When engaged in melee combat any attack roll suffers a -2 circumstantial penalty.
</p>

<h2 id="exposed">Exposed</h2>
<p class=tab>
An exposed creature is completely helpless and can be instantly reduced to 0 HP if a full-round action is taken to do so. An exposed creature must make a DC 10 + Damage dealt Level Check (1d20+ HD + Con). If they fail they drop immediately to 0 hp and automatically. Attacks against an exposed creature are considered critical threat.
</p>

<h2 id="flat-footed">Flat-footed</h2>
<p class=tab>
A flat-footed opponent is denied their dexterity, dodge, insight, and parry bonuses to AC. 
</p>

<h2 id="sickened">Sickened</h2>
<p class=tab>
Sickened creatures take a -2 to all rolls, and have their movement speed reduced by 10 ft.   
</p>

<h2 id="sleep">Sleep</h2>
<p class=tab>
A sleeping creature is exposed, unable to move, and does not threaten any squares. Any noise of listen DC 15 or higher gives a sleeping person a chance to wake up if they succeed on the listen check. A creature does have a -5 listen penalty while sleeping.
</p>

<h2 id="scared">Scared</h2>
<p class=tab>
A scared opponent is hesitant to resist, fight back, or deny the source of what has scared them. Against that opponent they suffer a -2 on attack rolls, will saves, and will strongly prefer staying out of range of that target. A scared creature is also more compliant to requests and will often honor them to avoid conflict at all. If a creature is more afraid of something else, they might not honor a request as they'll always priorities what has terrified them the most.
</p>

<h2 id="stifle">Stifle</h2>
<p class=tab>
A stifled opponent is overwhelmed by emotion be it natural or magically induced. They cannot take any actions if left alone, but if any offensive actions are taken against them they can dodge, defend, or protect themselves. If a stifle is magically induced any offensive actions on them grants them another immediate will save. Any reactive skill such as balance, spot, listen, etc... gain a -4 circumstance penalty. A stifled opponent is not considered flat-footed. 
</p>

<h2 id="stunned">Stunned</h2>
<p class=tab>
A stunned creature drops their weapons and cannot take any standard actions that round, as a result they threaten no squares. They can move at half speed. While stunned they gain a -2 dodge penalty to AC and Reflex Saves and a -4 circumstance penalty to acrobatics, balance, investigate, listen, and spot checks.
</P>

<h2 id="touch-attack">Touch Attack</h2>
<p class=tab>
This is an attack, be it melee or ranged, that ignores all the physical aspects of armor, since only contact need be made for it to be effective. Touch attacks roll against AC but without any armor bonus, shield bonus, natural armor bonus, and parry bonus.
