    <h1 id="conditions">Conditions</h1>
<p class.tab>Conditions are very temporary afflictions that belong in a category of their own, as they all auto-recover within a relatively short amount of time. Below is a list of all condition summaries.</p>

<h2 id="flat-footed">Flat-footed</h2>
<p>A flat-footed opponent is denied their dexterity, dodge, insight, and parry bonuses to AC. </p>
<h2 id="stifle">Stifle</h2>
<p>A stifled opponent is overwhelmed by emotion be it natural or magically induced. They cannot take any actions if left alone, but if any offensive actions are taken against them they can dodge, defend, or protect themselves. If a stifle is magically induced any offensive actions on them grants them another immediate will save. Any reactive skill such as balance, spot, listen, etc... gain a -4 circumstance penalty. A stifled opponent is not considered flat-footed. </p>
