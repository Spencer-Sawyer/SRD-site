<pre><code>There are a lot of different terms thrown around that may feel ill-defined. Below is a list of all the terms and what they mean.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Spell Slot</strong> - This is a use of a spell for that given level. If you have 3 spells per day for first-level spells, you have 3 first-level spell slots.</p>
<p><strong>Prepared Spell</strong> - The most common kind of spell, this is a spell that has to be prayed for, meditated for, or memorized at the beginning of the day. The number of prepared spells is limited by your Spell Slots.</p>
<p><strong>Known Spell </strong>- This is a spell you do not need to prepare, and can instead sacrifice an already prepared spell slot to cast this spell instead.</p>
<p><strong>Damage Reduction(DR)</strong> - This is a mitigation that resists all physical types of damage. Physical damage comes in the form of Bludgeoning, crushing, piercing, and slashing damage. Damage reduction will be formatted as Reduction Value / What bypasses it. For example, 5/piercing would reduce all incoming physical damage by 5, except piercing. A damage reduction of 5/- would reduce all incoming physical damage. There are some rarer types of damage reduction like #/Adamantine or #/magic. These would be DR that only adamantine can bypass or only a magical weapon can bypass.</p>
<p><strong>Energy Resistance(ER) </strong>- This is a mitigation that protects against energy damage typically done through magic. These types consist of Fire(heat), Acid, Ice(cold), Sonic, Force, electricity, negative, and positive. The format for this kind of resistance will be the name of the energy type and the mitigation value behind it. For example, Fire 10 will reduce all incoming heat and fire damage by 10. There are a handful of </p>
<p><strong>Fire(Heat)</strong> - This is high thermal energy-based damage, they are synonymous with each other as far as resistances are concerned. The only reason that one might be used in place of the other is for theming purposes. A concentrated light ray will burn you without the use of fire, for example. So it would be labeled as heat damage.</p>
<p><strong>Ice(Cold) </strong> - This is low thermal energy-based damage, they are synonymous with each other as far as resistances are concerned. Typically Ice damage will be paired with a physical damage type </p>
