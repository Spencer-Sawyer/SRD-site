    <h1 id="monsters">Monsters</h1>
<p class=tab>
An adventure without adversaries would be boring, and flavorless without the fun kind of monstrous creature's we've all come to enjoy in our fantasy role playing games. Here I will give some <em>examples</em> of monsters, but I always encourage the creation of custom monsters within a group to make things more personal and less predictable. See <a href="../#On%20Monster%20Creation">monster creation</a> for suggestions on how to build monsters.

<h2 id="inferentity">Inferentity</h2>
<p Class=tab>
A common creature often summoned by conjurers to do their bidding. They are partially created from the mind of the caster. When summoned by a magic user they are intelligent creatures acting with initiative and intelligence borrowed from the caster. They all contain knowledge of the planes that can be of assistance. They always speak the root language of the caster that summoned it. If these are encountered on their home plane and not summoned by a magic user, they are animalistic in intelligence and initiative.
</p>
<p class=tab>
There are several types of inferentity depending on which planes they come from, and mixed variations could exist. The common inferentity are Caustic, Decay, Fire, Frost, Tempest, and Vital.
