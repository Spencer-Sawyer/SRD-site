<h1 id="primary-definitions">Primary Definitions</h1>
<p>The most defining aspect of your character is their first definition. This will define the general path your character will take in the future. Choose carefully and review secondary definitions before making a final decision.</p>

<strong>Armor</strong>: None and shields (except tower shields)  <br />
<strong>Effect</strong>: Gain Uncanny Dodge, your character can no longer be flanked by anything less than 6 HD higher than your character. Your character cannot be caught flat-footed unless pinned. Tumbling is now done at full speed without penalty. When choosing to fight defensively, your character only takes a -2 to all attacks in the round instead of -4. These benefits are lost if your character wears any physical armor or a tower shield. Bracers of armor, bucklers, and full shields can be worn without losing these benefits.</p>
<h2 id="defender">Defender</h2>

<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Must have a d8 hit die or more, Con 14<br />
<strong>Armor</strong>: Light, medium, heavy, and all shields (<em>including</em> tower shields).<br />
<strong>Effect</strong>: Once per round you can intercept all attacks on an adjacent ally, from a single foe, as an immediate action. Gain Damage reduction 1/- this increases by one for every 6 HD.
