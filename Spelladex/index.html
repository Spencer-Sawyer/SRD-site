<h1 id="spells-terms">Spells Terms</h1>
<p>There are a number of terms and words used within spell casting that will help describe the use, category, and other details about the spell.</p>
<h2 id="school">School</h2>
<p>All spells are divided into schools, these are a broad view of how the spell functions. They can be broken into several types as seen here.  </p>
<p><strong>Abjuration</strong>: These are spells the provide protection from both the mundane and the arcane, as well as general anti-magic type spells. Those that primarily practice this school are called Interdictors.</p>
<p><strong>Compulsion</strong> This school is composed of spells that forcefully coerce others into action or inaction, be it for or against their own goals. Those that primarily practice this school are called Coercers.</p>
<p><strong>Conjuration</strong>: These are spells where a physical thing is created, be it a glob of acid, an elemental, or a floating sword. Often times these spells have to bypass the AC of the target rather than require a save. Those that practice this school are called Summoners.</p>
<p><strong>Divination</strong>: These are spells that grant the caster, or others, some form of insight. This would including scrying, seeing invisibility, predictive thoughts, and other types of similar effects. Those that primarily practice this school are called Seers.</p>
<p><strong>Evocation</strong>: These are spells that call flashes of energy to destroy things. This is typically limited to Acid, Fire, Ice, Force, and Sonic energies. These spells tend to require a save instead of a roll against a target's AC. Those that primarily practice this school are called War Mages.</p>
<p><strong>Illusion</strong>: These are spells that convince the senses of others that the unreal, is real. Those that primarily practice this school are called Illusionists.</p>
<p><strong>Thaumaturgy</strong>: These are spells that have control over positive and negative energy. As well as things themed around life and death. Those that primarily practice Thaumaturgy are called Vivimancers or Necromancers depending on preference.</p>
<p><strong>Transmutation</strong>: These are spells that modify a subject's capabilities, or modify a physical object. Those that primarily practice transmutation are called Engineers.</p>
<h2 id="spell-proficiency">Spell Proficiency</h2>
<p>Spell proficiency is added to Spells, Spell-like abilities(Sp), or Supernatural Abilities(Su) DC and any non-touch attack roll. It is also applied as a flat bonus for each damage/healing/warding dice for Spells, Spell-like abilities(Sp), or Supernatural Abilities(Su). For example, if a character has a spell that deals 5d6 damage and has a Casting Proficiency of 2 it will be 5d6+10 damage.</p>
