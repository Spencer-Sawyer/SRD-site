<h1 id="spell-casting">Spell Casting</h1>
<h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>
<p>Spells come in three varieties, Arcane, Divine, and Natural. There are also generalist spells which is a list borrowed from all three varieties. </p>
<p><strong>Arcane</strong>: Drawing from general magical energy arcane spells tend to be flashy and are derived either from a person's knowledge or a person's gumption. Some see it as a science, others an art. Either way, arcane spells tend to be associated with city-folk and their methods of magic.</p>
<p><strong>Divine</strong>: A deity will use a person as a conduit for their bidding, those favored in this manner have access to divine magic; a gift from their god. This does not mean they need to worship a specific god, a sufficiently fervent person can have multiple deities channeling through them, though the person might not realize who's tool they are.</p>
<p><strong>Nature</strong>: Those in touch with nature know its ways and its methods and how to use it to an end. Such casters tend to work with the natural world with an empathic understanding of their environment, they are able to shake rocks, control plants, or even become animals themselves.</p>
<p>All of these spells derive their effectiveness from a primary mental attribute, or PMA. This will determine the amount of spells per day, or spell slots, the character has. A minimum PMA of 10 + Spell level is needed to cast levels of that level. For example a 5th level spell would need a 15 PMA.</p>
<p><strong>PMA</strong>: Primary Mental Attribute. These are chosen at character creation and are selected from Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. Once selected it cannot be changed. Certain definitions and abilities have specific PMA requirements.</p>
<p><strong>PMA mod</strong>: This is the modifier from your primary mental attribute</p>
<p><strong>Components</strong>[M]: Spell components come in a lot of varieties and are consumed on the use of the spell. Most are very inexpensive and can be assumed purchased when, 'refilling your spell component pouch.' Any component that costs 1 GP or more must be specifically purchased and held within your inventory.</p>
<p><strong>Focus</strong>[F]: A focus is an object, sometimes required by spells, that helps the caster user their spells. If a focus has 10x the value of a material component, the spell can be cast without the material component. Focuses tend to be staves, orbs, wands, holy symbol, crystals, or anything that is thematic to the caster.</p>
<p><strong>Somatic</strong>[S]: Most spells have somatic components, which require hand, body, or other kinds of motions. If restricted spells that require somatic components cannot be cast.</p>
<p><strong>Verbal</strong>[V]: Most spells have verbal components. These are incantations, holy recitations, or other thematic vocalizations. If silenced in anyway spells that requite verbal components cannot be cast.</p>
<p><strong>Damage/Healing</strong>: A lot of spells deal damage and any spell that has a damage or healing roll involved also ads the PMA modifier at the end.</p>
<p><strong>Casting a Spell</strong>: Casting a spell is relatively simple your character takes the appropriate actions; immediate, swift, standard, or full-round action and the target of their spell makes a save. It is also possible an attack roll is made for a spell, if so, follow the kind of attack required. Please note a full-round spell finishes at the beginning of the cater's next turn.</p>
<p><strong>Spell Resistance</strong>: Spell resistance (SR) works like armor class, though it isn’t as easy to obtain. If a spell is subject to spell resistance, and the target has any. Simply roll 1d20 + Caster Level + any other mods you might have to it.</p>
<p><strong>Concentration</strong>: Concentration refers to a few different things in spell casting. In general, it’s based on the skill Concentration, which is the ability to hold a spell or cast a spell while adverse things are happening. For example: When you cast a spell it provokes an attack of opportunity from anyone who’s threatened squares the caster is in. If hit from that attack a concentration check will need to be made to see if you can cast the spell. Below are circumstances, and their DC, where concentration checks apply.</p>
<p>Damaged while casting: DC = Damage Dealt</p>
<p>Grappled: DC = 10; opposed grapple needed to even cast</p>
<p>Distracted: DC = 15</p>
<p>Casting Defensively: DC = 10 + Spell Level</p>
<p>Concentrating/Rage: These have their own rules see their entries.</p>
<p><strong>Concentrating</strong>: Some spells have a duration labeled as, "Concentration," or “Concentration Max X rounds.” This means you must focus on that spell and cannot cast any other spell or effect that has the duration described as "Concentration." Other standard actions can be taken. If you are struck, grappled, or otherwise distracted while maintaining a concentration spell, you must roll a concentration check.</p>
<p><strong>Metamagic</strong>: Metamagic is the magic of altering magic. All spell casters can apply the concept to their spells. They can prepare a lower-level spell into a higher-level spell slot and treat that spell as if it were in the higher-level slot for purposes of calculating the spell's DC. There are also feats that create modifications of this.</p>
<h2 id="simplex-spells"><strong>Simplex Spells</strong></h2>
<p>All casters get spells they can cast at their whim. These are spells so simple they take little to no energy to use. In essence, they only do one thing and do not do very much damage or healing overall. Most effects are limited, so when creating these bear this in mind.</p>
<p>Simplex spells are divided into Arcane, Divine, Generalist, and Natural and are selectable in accordance with the kind of magic a character can cast. At level up these can always be changed, feats can also be selected to gain further Simplex spells.</p>
<p>In general Basic casters have 2, Standard casters have 3, and Advanced casters have 4.</p>
<p>Be sure to read notes, as some take a long time to cast despite being simple.</p>
<p>All DCs for these spells are 10 + Primary Mental Attribute</p>
<p>See full spell list for full spell information, below are summaries</p>
<h3 id="advance-simplex-spells"><strong>Advance Simplex Spells</strong></h3>
