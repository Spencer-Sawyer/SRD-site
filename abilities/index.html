<h1 id="abilities">Abilities</h1>
<h2 id="terms">Terms</h2>
<p><strong>Abilities</strong>: Abilities are generally supernatural(Su) or extraordinary(Ex) tools a character has. Oftentimes they bring something completely new to the table that isn't available as a spell or feat. Oftentimes they follow a theme with several iterations on the same ability.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Die</strong> (HD): Your character's level after any level adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty Check</strong> (DC): Some abilities require a target make a save, and for that there will be a difficulty check. These come in two flavors. Mental based(Su) and Constitution based(Ex). They are calculated as follows 10 + 1/2 HD + primary mental modifier or 10 + 1/2 HD + constitution modifier. This will be determined in the ability itself</p>
<p><strong>Dispel Magic</strong>: Any ability that is a supernatural ability(Su) can be subject to dispel magic if specified. If this is the case use your HD as your caster level.</p>
<p><strong>Concentration</strong>: If an ability requires concentration treat it as a 5th level spell for purposes of calculating the concentration DC.</p>
<p><strong>Spell Resistance</strong>: If an ability is subject to spell resistance your HD is your effective caster level. Note that spell penetration does not benefit abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Iterative Growth</strong>: When a higher form of an ability is taken it replaces the previous ability. For example Improved Breath Weapon replaces Breath Weapon. </p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: There are prerequisites for these, the ability score requirements are a hard prerequisite. However, other prerequisites can be overridden with sufficient integration with the character's back story.</p>
<h2 id="ally-shielding-ex">Ally Shielding (Ex)</h2>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: PMA 14<br />
<strong>Use</strong>: 1 + 1 per 4 HD per day<br />
<strong>Action</strong>: Standard action<br />
<strong>Target</strong>: 30 ft radius centered on the user  <br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: 1 round per HD  </p>
<p>A strong defense allows for a more hearty offense they say. Allies are warded equal to the user's HD x PMA Modifier. This bonus applies to the targets as a whole. So if the caster has 40 warding the warding damage is taken before any HP damage is taken. Damage taken by anyone inside the radius reduces the whole ward's HP.</p>
<h2 id="animal-companion">Animal Companion</h2>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Character must not have a familiar or construct<br />
<strong>Effect</strong>: Gain an animal companion, the creature's type must be animal. This creature will gain HD as you gain HD, as well as the bonuses listed below. An animal always has 3 or less intelligence. Roll stats for your companion like you would a character or use the pre-rolled 18, 16, 14, 14, 12, 3; as your stats. Like player races, some animals get bonuses to certain stats, see the specific animal entry for information.</p>
<p><em>Devotion: If you are injured, crippled, or unconscious, your animal companion will either try to carry you away from danger, or defend your body by occupying your square against other attackers. While your animal companion is defending you, you cannot be finished off with an attack. Animals that can carry you away will prioritize that unless cornered.</em></p>

<h2 id="personal-construct">Personal Construct</h2>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Int 14+, character must not have a familiar or animal companion.</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong>: Gain a construct that will follow your commands and serve you in combat or other situations. These constructs have no intelligence or constitution scores and have standard construct traits. Charisma for all constructs is 10 and cannot be modified. A construct will need to be created from materials thematic to your character. Constructs gain HD as your character does. When building your construct, you can roll stats or distribute the following as you see fit into Strength, Dexterity or Wisdom: 18, 16, 12. Some things will need to be selected when creating your construct. Damage type will be based on what kind of limbs/weapons they use to fight. Select either piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning as the damage types for their natural  attacks. Constructs can be quadrupedal and have their base movement speed +10 but only get a single natural attack, or be bipedal and get two natural attacks. Constructs can only take Combatant progression charts and either medium or high attack bonuses.</p>
<p>If Small Sized: +2 Dex, -2 Strength, attacks damage do 1d6 and 18-20 with a x2 critical; base speed 20</p>

<p>The base armor for a construct is 10, money can be spent armoring it up as if applying a normal character's armor to it. Cost modifiers for the armor are the same as if for small, medium or large characters. This armor can also be enchanted. The weapons for your construct are free and considered masterwork, including the +1 bonus to attack. These can be enchanted for standard cost. Magic items can be created to increase a construct's skills, and will be attached to the associated slot. Constructs also cannot speak unless modified to do so. Personal constructs do not gain bonus feats or bonus abilities from their progression. The only abilities they get come from the Special column. They do gain standard feats at 1, 3, 6... etc.</p>

<p><em>Energy Absorption: Your construct is not only immune, but is repaired, instead of damaged, by anything that deals with the energy type they are powered with. e.g. Sonic, Acid, Positive, Negative, etc...</em></p>
<p><em>Energy Vent: Once per day per 3 HD the construct can vent whatever type of energy is powering it. If steam, then heat; if spirit power, then positive/negative energy; if arcane then damage type of your choosing. This will affect all adjacent squares dealing 5d6 damage/healing.

<p><em>Accelerate: Once per day, for rounds equal to the PMA of your character, the golem can act as if under the effects of the haste spell. These do not need to be used consecutively. Activating accelerate is a free action.</em></p>

<strong>Action</strong>: Standard <br />
<strong>Target</strong>: Self <br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: 1 minute per HD.</p>
<p>When activated a shroud of flower petals, leaves, or whatever chosen plant material works surrounds the caster and becomes a sort of armor. This grants +1 natural armor, which increases by 1 for every 4 HD. It also grants 2 natural vine swipes that have +5 ft of reach. These two attacks are at your highest base attack bonus and use their PMA as the modifier instead of Dex or Str. Damage is 1d6+PMA mod with a x2 critical.</p>
<h2 id="petal-shroud-su">Petal Shroud (Su)</h2>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: PMA 16+, Lesser Petal Shroud <br />
<strong>Use</strong>: Can be broken up as needed but total use per day cannot exceed maximum duration. <br />
<strong>Action</strong>: Standard <br />
<strong>Target</strong>: Self <br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: 1 minute per HD.</p>
<p>This functions as Lesser Petal Shroud, but the petals create a cloud that obscures all ranged attacks giving them a 20% miss chance. The vines also gain +1d6 acid damage and can be used for tripping. On top of this being in direct sunlight will grant the user 5 fast healing.</p>
<h2 id="petal-shroud-greater-su">Petal Shroud, Greater (Su)</h2>

<strong>Action</strong>: Standard <br />
<strong>Target</strong>: Self <br />

<strong>Target</strong>: Single Target <br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: Instant   </p>
<p>Select a target,  take a five foot step to them, if they are now, or still in a threatened square make an attack against them. This attack, if it hits, ignores 5 DR of any kind and deals maximum damage. If a critical hit is scored, only the first damage roll is maximized. Similarly, a sneak attack does not get to max its damage dice. This action does not provoke an attack of opportunity. This 5 ft step is separate and can be combined with the 5 foot step free action.</p>

<p>If your character falls to 1/5 (20%) of their health they can, at any time in combat, even not on their turn, self-destruct. This has to be actively done by your character, being killed does not activate this ability. The detonation deals 2d6 damage of your chosen damage type for every HD your character has to enemies. An equivalent amount of health is healed to allies within the radius. After the detonation your character's health will be reduced to lethal levels and their body will be reduced to ashes. After 48 hours your character will reconstitute from the ash. Your character will suffer a -2 constitution as well as fatigue for 72 hours.

Nothing can cure these penalties outside of a <em>Wish</em>.</p>

<p>As a standard action, the shroud can be exerted by the character. This will cause the effect to flare, dealing 1d6 per round of duration remaining, of the applicable damage type to enemies within the radius. A reflex saved can me made for half and partial.

<p>Synergy: Gain secondaries if you have Quills of the Phoenix.</p>

<p>After getting your result, roll 2d6 + character HD + charisma modifier to determine the maximum number of Undead HD affected. The nearest undead will flee for 1 minute and the effect radiates outward to the next closest after that until the affected HD is used up. If a cleric moves within 10 feet of an affected undead, the turn is overcome and the undead acts normally. Note -- if a cleric has twice as many HD as an affected undead, that undead will be completely destroyed instead of fleeing.</p>
<p>Special: If a good or neutral character becomes evil, this ability can be replaced with control undead should they go through an atonement ritual.</p>
