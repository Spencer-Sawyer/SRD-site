<p><strong>Abilities </strong>- Abilities are generally supernatural(Su) or extraordinary(Ex) tools a character has. Oftentimes they bring something completely new to the table that isn't available as a spell or feat. Oftentimes they follow a theme with several iterations on the same ability.</p>
<p><strong>Hit Die</strong>(HD): Your character's level after any level adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulty Check</strong>(DC): Some abilities require a target make a save, and for that there will be a difficulty check. These come in two flavors. Mental based(Su) and Constitution based(Ex). They are calculated as follows 10 + 1/2 HD + primary mental modifier or 10 + 1/2 HD + constitution modifier. This will be determined in the ability itself</p>
<p><strong>Dispel Magic</strong>: Any ability that is a supernatural ability(Su) can be subject to dispel magic if specified. If this is the case use your HD as your caster level.</p>
<p><strong>Concentration</strong>: If an ability requires concentration treat it as a 5th level spell for purposes of calculating the concentration DC.</p>
<p><strong>Spell Resistance</strong>: If an ability is subject to spell resistance your HD is your effective caster level. Note that spell penetration does not benefit abilities.</p>
<p><strong>Iterative Growth</strong>: When a higher form of an ability is taken it replaces the previous ability. For example Improved Breath Weapon replaces Breath Weapon. </p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: There are prerequisites for these, the ability score requirements are a hard prerequisite. However, other prerequisites can be overridden with sufficient integration with the character's backstory.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Ally Shielding</span></strong>(Ex)</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: PMA 14</p>
<p><strong>Use</strong>: 1/day per day +1 per day for every HD divisible by 4</p>
<p><strong>Action</strong>: Standard</p>
<p><strong>Target</strong>: 30 ft radius centered on the user</p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong>: 1 round /HD</p>
<p><strong>  </strong>A strong defense allows for a more hearty offense they say. Allies are warded equal to the user's HD x PMA Modifier. This bonus applies to the targets as a whole. So if the caster has 40 warding the warding damage is taken before any HP damage is taken. Damage taken by anyone inside the radius reduces the whole ward's HP.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Animal Companion</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Character must not have a familiar or construct</p>
<p><strong>Effect</strong>: Gain an animal companion, the creature's type must be animal. This creature will gain HD as you gain HD, as well as the bonuses listed below. An animal always has 3 or less intelligence. Roll stats for your companion like you would a character or use the pre-rolled 18, 16, 14, 14, 12, 3; as your stats. Like player races, some animals get bonuses to certain stats, see the specific animal entry for information.</p>
<p><em>Devotion: If you are injured, crippled, or unconscious, your animal companion will either try to carry you away from danger, or defend your body by occupying your square against other attackers. While your animal companion is defending you, you cannot be finished off with an attack. Animals that can carry you away will prioritize that unless cornered.</em></p>

This grants +1 natural armor, which increases by 1 for every 4 HD. It also grants 2 natural vine swipes that have +5 ft of reach. These two attacks are at your highest base attack bonus and use their PMA as the modifier instead of dex or strength. Damage is 1d6+PMA mod with a x2 critical.

A hurled object with lesser does 1d4 damage for every 10 lbs it weighs (Max 20d4) with an effective range of 20 feet from its initial position. An object can be thrown only if it is at the characterâs maximum light load weight or less. This is treated as a ranged attack but the character's caster level is the attack bonus and is modified by their mental attribute. If the object is over 25 lbs this is treated as a touch attack. Maximum movable object by weight is 5 lbs / HD

<p>Sustained pushing at the max limit will fatigue a character after 2 rounds and exhaust a character after 5 rounds. When pushing or pulling things in medium load's weight a character will be fatigued after 10 rounds and exhausted after 25. Pushing, pulling, and carrying objects is not an instant action and uses the duration instead.</p>
<p>If the target of your telekinesis is living, the only actions that can be attempted is are Bull Rush and Overrun. Treat the character's caster level as their base attack and their mental attribute modifier as their strength. This is considered to be a bull rush attempt from a small sized creature.

<pre><code>With this ability one can move objects around and carry them without touching them.  Their primary mental attribute determines carry, lift, and push weights as if it were strength for the purposes of use. A hurled object with improved does 1d6 damage for every 10 lbs it weighs with an effective range of 40 feet from its initial position. An object can be thrown only if it is at the maximum light load weight or less. This is treated as a ranged attack but the character's caster level is the attack bonus and is modified by their mental attributes. If the object is over 25 lbs this is treated as a touch attack. Maximum movable object by weight is 10 lbs / HD
</code></pre>
<p>Sustained pushing at the max limit will fatigue a character after 2 rounds and exhaust a character after 5 rounds. When pushing or pulling things in medium load's weight a character will be fatigued after 10 rounds and exhausted after 25. Pushing or pulling an object within the character's light load will not fatigue them. Pushing, pulling, and carrying objects is not an instant action and uses the duration instead.</p>
<p>If the target of your telekinesis is living, the only actions that can be attempted is are Bull Rush and Overrun. Treat the character's caster level as their base attack and their mental attribute modifier as their strength. This is considered to be a bull rush attempt from a medium sized creature. Unlike the standard uses of these, they provoke no attacks of opportunity unless they are within melee range, and they cannot simply be avoided.</p>
<p>Disarm attempts can be made with improved telekinesis. For purposes of calculation the character's caster level is the Base Attack, and the primary mental attribute modifies it. Improved telekinesis is considered to be a single handed standard weapon. If successful the weapon can be dropped, or thrown using the formula above for damage added to the weapon damage.</p>
