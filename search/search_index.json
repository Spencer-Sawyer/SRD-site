This idea was born from having played several table top systems and finding the purely open-class character systems lacking in flavor, and the closed-class system games always missing the mark on how a character is imagined. Instead of a system writing a character's history into its base abilities, a person should be able to choose exactly how their character is; without being flat and bland like a completely open-class system is. Rule Zero Like most table top systems there will be one person building and running a campaign setting and story. Throughout the explanations and examples, the setting of Estrella will be used. Any and all of these rules and examples can and should be modified to suit a group's specific desires and needs. Little effort will be given into balancing this system as the idea is more about having fun, telling stories, and allowing character growth arcs to enrich the player experience. If a player is making things unfun, it is suggested that the person running the group (or the group as a whole) address the complaints with that player. This is especially true if a player is building something that comes off as overpowering or condescending. The Definition Master (DM) has the ultimate word in how something should happen. It is suggested that discussion with the group happen first, so it doesn't feel dictatorial. Example Setting The Setting given in all the example, as said earlier, is called Estrella.

They introduce flavor and intrigue into how a character is. These can be taken at any time willingly by a player unless specified in the description. Afflictions can also be bestowed on a character either through massive damage, curses, or other means through the course of a campaign. Most of these effects are permanent unless removed with a break-enchantment spell, in the case of magically induced ones; or a Cure Affliction spell/effect. Temporary effects often turn into a permanent effect. You will see mention of conditions in other pages, those are similar to afflictions but always self correct and last for very limited amounts of time. Types There are several types of afflictions and their chances which can be cured, how, or if they can even be cured at all. All afflictions can be applied from a spell, in which case their type because Curse. Refer to the list below for more information Curse : These are bestowed with the \"Bestow Curse\" Spell any non-wound affliction can be applied to a target with this spell. No matter which is applied, the curse curing methods can be used. A good example of a famous curse would be Lycanthropy. Disease : Any affliction caused by pathogens, magical or otherwise, fall into this category. This does not include diseases that stem from a person's own body. When a disease is given, pick the appropriate disease based afflictions and apply them all. A good example of a disease would be Influenza (which would fall under Sickly - Respiratory) Genetic : These are taken at character creation, and cannot be cured with anything less than a wish spell. A Genetic affliction is part of the character's design. These typically would take the form of auto-immune disease, genetic disorders, and other things that the body does poorly. When a Genetic affliction is chosen, pick the appropriate afflictions and apply them all. A good example would be Sarcoidosis (All three \u201cSickly\u201d afflictions and Bad Joints). Injury : When a wound becomes permanent it is an injury. Some things bypass the wound category and go straight into injury. Injuries require time to recover but can be healed with non-magical means. A good example is a broken leg that was set wrong. Heal Skill DCs are specific to the injury, some require surgery. Wound : After a critical hit there is a 20% chance to get a wound. A wound is a temporary affliction that has a 50% chance to become an Injury if not healed. All wound heal DCs are equal to 10 + affected character's HD - Constitution Modifier. This also required the use of a Wound-Binding Kit. A good example of a wound would be an arrow through the knee. Name Applicable Cure Method Curse Remove Curse, Break Enchantment, and/or Wish Injury Remove Injury, Restoration, Heal, and/or Heal Skill Check (See entry), and/or Wish Genetic Wish Disease Remove Disease, Greater Restoration, Panacea, and/or Wish Wound Medicinal Mending, Heal Skill Check (See Entry), and/or Wish Curse While any affliction can be applied as a curse, below are the afflictions that are exclusively curses.

Without training and time to adapt, your character will attack all living creatures on sight during a triggering event. E.g. a Full Moon, Noon-Time Sun, and many other potential triggers. Fire spells that affect the lycanthrope panic them for 5 rounds. After the panic wears off, fire spells will not cause panic again for 24 hours. All lycanthropes become carnivore obligates.

They are often called Harvesters or Gardeners as colloquial nicknames. They resemble anthropomorphic hummingbirds and are capable of extremely deft flight. Within Estrella they are food producers, both honey and fruits primarily. Size : Small This species lacks sexual dimorphism in height and weight Males of this species are slightly more vibrant and tend to have an iridescent band of color on their wings, while the females are matte grey in the same location. They average 2'9'' to 3'7'' in height and weigh between 35-70 lbs. Creation Information Attribute Modifications : -2 Constitution and +2 Intelligence. Speed : 20 ft. Special : A bonus secondary definition at first level and fly speed 40 ft. (Perfect) Crockokin Art by Mab@ Twitter Description Living in the swamps of Colomancha, and typically running sturgeon farms, the Crockokin live with their cousins the Varanukin. Despite having such a different culture from the rest of Estrella, they are fiercely loyal to the republic. Size : Medium This species lacks sexual dimorphism Members of this species lack obvious primary and secondary sex characteristics. It is difficult to discern the sex of a Crockokin without physical examination, which is considered quite rude. They average 6'4' to 7'3\" Weights range from 350-500 lbs, and typically are quite lithe at these weights due to high muscle density. Creation Information Attribute Modifications : +2 Strength and -2 Charisma. Speed 30 ft. Special : Swim Speed 30 ft, gain a bonus feat at first level, and natural armor +2. Custom Always be willing to build a custom species with any player should they desire it. Typically the patterns are Ability scores +4, -2, and some sort of progression bonus. e.g. A bonus feat, bonus skill points, an extra ability, or extra definitions. Sometimes the ability scores will be less due to extra features; like flying or natural armor. Other times extra bonuses are also given, like dark vision, but this is underwhelming enough not to reduce another bonus. Elf Art by Mab@ Twitter Description Elves in Estrella have a longer view of history and knowledge of the culture, rather than their fast-lived countrymen. Typically occupying positions in cultural institutions they try to guide the arts, philosophies, and principles of the country with a gentle, if not condescending, touch. Elves are very rarely found outside of cities and balk at the idea of living in planes, deserts, or mountains. Size : Medium Heights are sexually dimorphic: Females range from 4\u20193\u2019\u2019 to 5\u20194\u2019\u2019\u2019 examples beyond either threshold are very rare. Males range from 4\u20198\u2019\u2019 to 5\u20199\u2019\u2019 examples beyond either threshold are very rare. Weight is rather variable and dependent on height. A healthy average female will weigh around 70-120 lbs. A healthy average male will weigh around 90-140 lbs. Creation Information Attribute Modifications : +4 Dexterity and -2 Constitution. Speed : 40 ft. Special : Dim-light vision, a bonus feat at first level, and base skill growth +1. Goblin Art by Mab@ Twitter Description Living primarily within the rim and underneath the high peaks region of Estrella, the goblins are known to be isolationist from the rest of the Estrella citizenry, primarily due to a proclivity for living underground and within cave systems. The grand majority of technological development in the past century has stemmed out of the goblin cities found within The Rim. They are a matriarchal society, sort of. The region is run democratically and does send representatives to the Estrella senate. These tend to be highly astute females, as their culture tends to value beautiful goblins over all else. As the saying goes, \"Goblin men think with the wrong head.\" Size : Small Heights range from 3\u2019 to 3'8\" examples beyond either threshold are very rare.

Those that primarily practice this school are called Coercers. Conjuration : These are spells where a physical thing is created, be it a glob of acid, an elemental, or a floating sword. Often times these spells have to bypass the AC of the target rather than require a save. Those that practice this school are called Summoners. Divination : These are spells that grant the caster, or others, some form of insight. This would including scrying, seeing invisibility, predictive thoughts, and other types of similar effects. Those that primarily practice this school are called Seers. Evocation : These are spells that call flashes of energy to destroy things. This is typically limited to Acid, Fire, Ice, Force, and Sonic energies. These spells tend to require a save instead of a roll against a target's AC. Those that primarily practice this school are called War Mages. Illusion : These are spells that convince the senses of others that the unreal, is real. Those that primarily practice this school are called Illusionists. Thaumaturgy : These are spells that have control over positive and negative energy. As well as things themed around life and death.

Oftentimes they bring something completely new to the table that isn't available as a spell or feat. Oftentimes they follow a theme with several iterations on the same ability. Hit Die (HD): Your character's level after any level adjustments. Difficulty Check (DC): Some abilities require a target make a save, and for that there will be a difficulty check. These come in two flavors. Mental based(Su) and Constitution based(Ex). They are calculated as follows 10 + 1/2 HD + primary mental modifier or 10 + 1/2 HD + constitution modifier. This will be determined in the ability itself Dispel Magic : Any ability that is a supernatural ability(Su) can be subject to dispel magic if specified. If this is the case use your HD as your caster level. Concentration : If an ability requires concentration treat it as a 5th level spell for purposes of calculating the concentration DC. Spell Resistance : If an ability is subject to spell resistance your HD is your effective caster level. Note that spell penetration does not benefit abilities. Iterative Growth : When a higher form of an ability is taken it replaces the previous ability. For example Improved Breath Weapon replaces Breath Weapon. Prerequisites : There are prerequisites for these, the ability score requirements are a hard prerequisite. However, other prerequisites can be overridden with sufficient integration with the character's back story. Ally Shielding (Ex) Prerequisite : PMA 14 Use : 1 + 1 per 4 HD per day Action : Standard action Target : 30 ft radius centered on the user Duration : 1 round per HD A strong defense allows for a more hearty offense they say. Allies are warded equal to the user's HD x PMA Modifier. This bonus applies to the targets as a whole. So if the caster has 40 warding the warding damage is taken before any HP damage is taken. Damage taken by anyone inside the radius reduces the whole ward's HP. Animal Companion Prerequisite : Character must not have a familiar or construct Effect : Gain an animal companion, the creature's type must be animal. This creature will gain HD as you gain HD, as well as the bonuses listed below. An animal always has 3 or less intelligence. Roll stats for your companion like you would a character or use the pre-rolled 18, 16, 14, 14, 12, 3; as your stats. Like player species, some animals get bonuses to certain stats, see the specific animal entry for information. Devotion: If you are injured, crippled, or unconscious, your animal companion will either try to carry you away from danger, or defend your body by occupying your square against other attackers. While your animal companion is defending you, you cannot be finished off with an attack. Animals that can carry you away will prioritize that unless cornered. Character HD Natural Armor Adj. Str/Dex Adj. Special 1st - 2nd +0 +1 Link, share spells 3rd - 4th +2 +1 Evasion 5th - 6th +3 +2 Devotion 7th - 8th +4 +2 Improved Bull Rush 9th - 10th +5 +3 - 11th - 12th +6 +3 Improved Evasion 13th -14th +7 +4 - 15th - 16th +8 +4 Improved Overrun 17th - 18th +9 +5 - 19th - 20th +10 +5 - Natural Armor Adjustment: This bonus is in addition to whatever base natural armor the creature has. So if it has a base of +2 then at level 20 the total natural armor of the creature will be +12. This stacks with Natural Armor Enhancement bonuses. Arcane Blast (Su) [Magic] Prerequisite : PMA 16+ Use : 1 + 1 per 6 HD per day Action : Full Round Range : Long (250 ft + 25 ft per HD) Target : Single Target Duration : Instant Saving Throw : Fortitude half; Reflex half, see rules DC : PMA Based Spell Resistance : No Your character accumulates a large amount of arcane energy and releases it in a powerful burst on a single target within range. This target must make a Fortitude Save DC = 10 + 1/2 HD + PMA for half damage. Any targets within 10 ft of the primary target must make a reflex save of the same DC or take damage equal to half the base damage rolled against the primary target. As a note the caster can choose to not have it explode. This attack deals 1d10 force damage per caster level. After using this ability cannot be used for 1d4+1 rounds. A spell slot of 5th level or higher can be sacrificed to enable a secondary effect on the blast: Stun : Stun's primary target for 1 round/spell slot level if fortitude save is failed Knock Back : pushes target back 5 ft/spell slot level if fortitude save is failed Recover : Heal caster for 1d6/spell slot level Regenerative Ward : Ward caster for PMA x spell slot level for rounds equal to 1 per 2 CL.

The type chosen for your character should be based on their strength first, as heavier armor weighs a lot more, then maximum dexterity mod. It is best to run with an armor that caters to the maximum allowable dexterity modifier to AC. Armor Bonus This is the base armor bonus for the armor and is added to the AC of the character Maximum Dexterity This is the limit to how much of your character's dexterity modifier can be applied to armor class. A character with a +4 to dexterity wearing full plate would not be able to apply any of that bonus to AC, but it would apply to other things such as attacks, skills, and saves. Weight Weight here is figuring in the approximate weight for these classes of armor, the weight of the undergarment, which is a gambeson, is figured in. Movement Modifier This is the penalty taken to movement speed. So if the armor has -5 and your character has movement of 30; your character's movement would be 25 with that armor on. Check Penalty Check penalties are the negatives taken to skills that require movement, like climb, swim, tumble, etc.. While wearing the armor, or having a shield in your inventory, these penalties apply. Please note having a shield in some sort of pocket dimension like a magical bag will remove the penalty.

This bonus stacks with any character growth based damage reduction or armor enhancement based reduction. So from feats, applicable abilities, or definitions. This damage reduction will not stack with any spell derived damage reduction. Masterwork Masterwork armor is a higher quality build of whatever the root armor is. On top of gaining the masterwork damage reduction listed in the chart, the armor's weight is also reduced by 5 lbs, the check penalty is reduced by 1, and the movement modifier is reduced by 5. A masterwork armor costs 30 go more than the base cost. Masterwork increases the base hardness by 2 and HP by 10 Masterwork shields are made from higher quality materials and are often crafted better. Masterwork shields have their check penalties reduced by 1 and costs 30 gp more than the base price. Masterwork increases the base hardness by 2 and HP by 10 Spell Failure Spell Failure is determined by weight. Light armor has a 15% spell failure chance, Medium armor has a 30% spell failure chance, and heavy armor has a 50% spell failure chance. This failure chance only applies if the spell is arcane and requires somatic components. Divine and Nature spells are not affected by this as the somatic components are far simpler. Shields Shields are held pieces of mostly wood, sometimes metal in the case of bucklers, that are either center gripped or strapped to the users arms. If a character is trained with a shield they can use two handed weapons and bows while also wielding a shield. If a character is not trained they cannot wield a shield with a two handed weapon, and its check penalty also applies to all attacks along with any other penalties. Shields Bash Shield Bashing is an attack action that can be performed in place of any of your characters attacks.

This is done through a turn based system in which dice are rolled to determine the outcome of such a conflict. The following rules will explain how to do this and all the nuance involved. Basics Health Points (HP) Your character has a number a health points that represent their current condition in combat. Lose HP doesn't necessarily mean that they've been cut or hit but just a decrease in their overall stamina to fight. HP is determined by a character's chosen progression chart and their constitution. When damage is taken it is subtracted from your current HP total. If your character's HP reaches 0 they fall unconscious and gain an injury. From here follow the rules on death. Hit points recover at a rate of Constitution modifier x Hit Dice per day without medical treatment. Non-Lethal Damage (NLD) Your character can take hits and affects that are intended to render them unconscious. When NLD is taken it is added to the character starting from 0. If your character's NLD is equal to or greater than your character's current HP total, they faint. NLD heals at a rate five times faster than HP. Weapons/Focuses/Shields Your character has two hands and can wield a weapon in one, a shield in one, or a focus in one. In the case of a two-handed weapon, a character can wield a shield and a two handed weapon at the same time. To cast spells a caster must have a hand free or be holding a focus in one hand. This system does not support dual wielding normally, in the future there might be some alternative rules for it. Use of weapon/armor untrained : A character wearing armor that is not trained will take a check penalty to attacks, movement skills, riding, and have a 50% spell failure chance. When untrained with a weapon. A character does not threaten square and suffers a -3 training penalty to attack and damage. Death Your character has hit 0 HP and is now wounded. To die your character needs to fail 3 death-saves (see options below). If they are hit by an opponent during this time, it is considered instant death. If your character has taken enough damage from a single hit to equal one-half their HP, and it reduces them to zero, they are counted as having failed 2 death-saves. If they take damage equal to their HP total and are reduced to zero, it is considered instant death. Death-saves can be done in several ways. Check below for options that best suite your group. In death, all are equal : Roll a d% and if the number is 51 or higher it is a save. If it is 50 or lower, it is a fail. Every failure makes the next roll 10% more difficult. A new attempt can only be done once a round if in combat. Stats matter! : A fortitude save must be made. DC is equal to 10 + Character Hit Dice - Constitution modifier. Brutality : A fortitude save must be made. DC is equal to 10 + damage dealt that dropped your character to 0. Initiative Roll Start combat with an initiative roll. This should be done by rolling 1d20 and adding your character's initiative bonus to the roll. If there is a conflict of two rolls being the same, have the conflicting characters roll against each other and arrange them by high to low before slotting them into your initiative order. As a suggested rule, divide your bonus by 100 and add it to the end as a decimal to help reduce the amount of initiative conflicts. Example: 1d20+8 with a roll of 12 would be 20.08* Combat Round A combat round is when all of the turns have been taken and the current initiative order is back at the top. The duration of a combat round is approximately 6 seconds. Space Space is the amount of squares a character takes up. For most characters this will by 5 ft., or one square. Please note, small characters take up 5 ft as well. Reach Reach is how many squares a character threatens. Medium and Small size creatures with non-reach weapons threaten all adjacent squares. Smaller than small size must occupy the same square as an opponent. If a medium size creature has a reach weapon their reach expands out another set of squares out. A small size creature using a reach weapon does the same, but loses the corners of the larger square. Diagram Pending Size Modifiers For many combat maneuvers size effects quite a few different rolls. Depending on the size of the create the size modifier might change. Sometimes size helps some times it hinders depending on the rolls. Opposed Rolls For advanced combat maneuvers they will often make mention of opposed rolls. These are rolls where the aggressor and defender during a maneuver must roll against each other. whichever of the two rolls highers is the winner. Turn and Actions A character's turn is broken down into action types, things here can get a bit granular. Primarily a turn is broken into a move action, a standard action, free actions, and a swift action should they have any. A standard action can instead be replaced with a character's attack action(s). Move Action A move action is typically limited to readying a weapon, moving up to your character's movement. Most move actions provoke attacks of opportunity, a feature explained later. In place of a move action a *five-foot step* can be taken in its place, which provokes no attacks of opportunity. Standard Action A standard action is something that takes more thought and energy, such as lighting a lantern, casting a spell, using abilities, and so on. If something is labeled as a standard action, it takes the entire standard action to do it. Your character's standard action can be given up for another move action, but not vice-versa. In place of standard actions a character can instead take all of its attack actions. Most characters start with one attack action, though as their base attack bonus increases the number of attack actions will increase. This will be denoted in the attack curve chart as +x/+y/+z... when there is a slash and a number that tells you the base attack bonus used with that attack. If your character has three attacks, they can get three attack actions in a round. Please note if attack actions are used, no standard actions can be taken. Free Action A free action is something that can be done with little to no thought and at the same time as other actions. This would include speaking, grabbing something from a readily available place on the character's person, drawing a weapon while moving, and whatever else might fit. No two free actions can be the same action, but a character is allowed as many free actions as they can use. Swift Action A swift action, sometimes called a bonus action, are actions that can occur with everything else happening. These are often spells or abilities, rarely any kind of physical or martial combat maneuver. If a spell or ability is labeled as a swift action, it is one. A character can only use a single swift action per round. Full Round Action A full round action takes the entire round, so it begins on a characters turn, and ends at the beginning of the next character's turn. This means the character on the following term can act normally again. No move, swift, standard or immediate actions can take place during a Full Round Action. Often times these are slow casting spells, such as summons, slow to execute abilities like charge or trample Immediate Action The rarest kind of action is an immediate action, sometimes called a reaction. These actions can be used at any point during a round by a character. A character can only use one immediate action per round. Move Actions Moving : Moving up to character's movement is considered a move action. When moving out of a threatened square, this provokes an attack of opportunity. Item Retrieval : Getting an item from a well-organized bag is a move action and provokes an attack of opportunity. Activating Motion based items : Items that require it be moved or twisted or otherwise manipulated in less than a button or command word, are move actions. This would be something like a Rod of Sealing, where the rod has to be moved in a square around the target. This provokes an attack of opportunity. Drawing a weapon : When drawing a weapon during movement is not specified, or the character is standing still, it is a move action. This provokes an attack of opportunity. Standing/Dropping : Standing up or dropping to prone is a movement action. This provokes an attack of opportunity. 5-foot step : a 5-foot step is a special move action where a character carefully moves to avoid being struck. This can sometimes be called a shift or a reposition. Drinking a Potion : Drinking a potion is a move action Standard Actions Attack(s) : Using your attack, or multiple attacks, takes the place of your standard action slot. Somethings are considered attack actions that must be used with an attack roll. This would be some spell touch attacks, trips, sunders, and disarms. Casting a Spell : Most spells are standard actions and casting one provokes an attack of opportunity. Grappling : Grappling is a standard action and provokes an attack of opportunity. See Advanced Combat Actions for further details on Grappling. Shove : Pushing a creature into another square. Use Activated items : Items that are use-activated. This would be something like a Free Actions Speaking : Speaking is a free action, try to keep it to a 6 second blurb or simple thought in combat. Simple item retrieval : If an item is on a belt hoop, in a very easily accessed pocket, or stored for quick usage, retrieving it is a free action. Command word/thought activated items : Some magical items are activated through thoughts or command words, activating these are free actions. Swift Actions Ability/Spell Specified : The only kinds of swift actions are specified in abilities and spell entries. No swift action provokes an attack of opportunity. Immediate Action Attack of Opportunity : If at any point during your round a creature leaves one of your threatened squares, and isn't using a 5-foot step, you can make an attack of opportunity on them as an immediate action. Other actions can also allow for an attack of opportunity as specified in their entries. Without feats, a character only gets one attack of opportunity in a round. Use of a held action : A character can hold its move or standard action until a condition is met. When/If the condition is met they can act immediately with the prepared action. This will move their turn to that point in the initiative. Combat Actions Below are the rules for each combat action that can be taken, both advanced and standard. Attack : A normal attack is done by rolling 1d20 + Base Attack Bonus + Strength/Dexterity Mod + size modifiers + other modifiers. It is then compared to the opponents Armor Class (AC). If your attack is equal to or greater than the opponents AC it is considered a hit. Shield Bashing : Shield Bashing is an attack action that can be performed in place of any of your characters attacks. The attack roll is 1d20 + Base Attack of that attack action + Strength or Dexterity (whichever is higher) + any other modifiers. Bucklers do 1d4 damage, Full Shields deal 1d6 damage, and Tower Shields deal 1d10 damage. Ranged Attack : A ranged attack is done by rolling 1d20 + Base Attack + Dexterity + size modifiers + any other modifiers. Like normal attacks it also compares against AC to determine if a hit happens. If in a threatened square this will provoke an attack of opportunity. When shooting through ally squares there is up to a 50% chance you hit your ally by accident depending on how much of the allied square the shot goes through. This is done by ear and there are no hard and fast rules on the percentages. Multiple Attacks : When a character has more than a +5 base attack bonus they gain another attack action at 5 less attack bonus, up to a maximum of four attacks. So if a character's base attack is +11 they get a second attack at +6 and a third attack at +1. This will be shown in charts as +11/+6/+1. This means when attacking the first attack in a round is the most likely to hit, and the last attack is the least. Note: Typically advanced combat maneuvers that are attack actions use the bonus from the attack order. So if a character does a disarm as their second attack. The melee touch attack uses the bonus for the character's second attack. Damage : Damage is rolled after hitting an opponent. Each weapon has it's own die type, which will be listed in the weapon entry. Then you add in strength and other modifiers after the roll. Reckless Fighting : This is an option when attacking to take a -4 dodge penalty to AC and gain a +2 circumstance bonus to damage. Defensive Fighting : This is an option when attacking to take a -4 circumstance penalty to attack and gain a +2 circumstance bonus to AC. Full Defensive Posture : This is a full round action in which your character does not attack, but instead focuses on defending themselves. When in Full Defensive Posture a character gains +4 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex Saves. Melee Touch Attack : This is usually a component to a spell, but it's an attack where armor does not matter since the effect need only make contact. Roll like any ranged attack but the target does not apply any Shield, Parry, Armor, or Natural armor to their AC. Dexterity, Deflection, Dodge, Insight and Luck bonuses still apply. As a special note if a spell requires a melee touch attack, the spell does not provoke an attack of opportunity even if in a threatened square. Weapon Fixation (Unarmed) and its follow up feats, apply to melee touch attacks when rolling to hit. Ranged Touch Attack : This is usually a component to a spell, but it's an attack where armor does not matter since the effect need only make contact. Roll like any ranged attack but the target does not apply any Shield, Parry, Armor, or Natural armor to their AC. Dexterity, Deflection, Dodge, Insight and Luck bonuses still apply. Casting a spell/using an ability : A spell being cast is simply called out, the DM will then check to see if you are in any threatened squares. Once done then the effect of the spell is explained by the player the monster must save against the spell. Please note some spells incorporate an attack, see attack rules above. Advance Combat Maneuvers There are things that can be done in combat that are a bit more involved than simply rolling an attack and damage. These things tend to have alternate outcomes that allow for the martially minded to control the combat arena a bit more. Much of these attacks work the same way, but will be explained as fully as they can be. Disarm : This is an attack action. To initiate a disarm, the aggressor must have as free hand or a disarming weapon. The aggressor will make a melee touch attack against the defender. This attack uses the attack bonus of the current attack, not always the highest. This provokes an attack of opportunity from the defender. If the defender is successful in dealing damage the aggressor takes a -4 penalty on the following opposed roll. The targets must then make opposed dexterity rolls. If the aggressor succeeds, the defender's weapon drops to the floor in an adjacent square. If the defender succeeds, the attempt fails. Size modifiers apply. Note: Attack of opportunity only applies if the aggressor is in the defender's threatened squares. Feigned Strike : As a standard action your character can chose to do a feigned strike. The opponent must make a level check (1d20 + HD + Wisdom modifier) or discern motive against your bluff roll. If they lose, they will be considered flat-footed for the rest of the round. Grapple : Grabbing another foe and holding onto them is a grapple. This is tone through a few simple steps. This is a standard action. To initiate a grapple attempt, the aggressor must make a melee touch attack. This attack uses base attack + Strength or Dexterity, whichever is higher. This provokes an attack of opportunity from the defender. If the defender is successful in dealing damage the aggressor takes a -4 penalty on the following opposed roll. Next the aggressor and defender make opposed grapple rolls. This will be the grapple modifier on your character sheet. Typically this roll is 1d20 + Highest Base Attack Bonus + Strength + Size modifier. The defender can instead substitute an escape artist for the opposed grapple roll. If the defender wins the grapple fails. If the aggressor wins the opponent is now grappled. At the beginning of every turn the defender can make another opposed grapple (or escape artist) as a free action to try to escape. The defender does not threaten any squares, and is flat footed against every opponent except the aggressor. They cannot move unless the aggressor is the one that moves them. Only weapons considered as unarmed can be used in the grapple. The defender can attack normally with unarmed attacks. The aggressor has a lot of options. Below is a small list of options that the aggressor can do. With the exception of using non-lethal unarmed attacks, all the rest require opposed grapple checks. If the defender succeeds the technique fails, but they remain grappled. Attack with non-lethal unarmed attacks : Attacking can be done normally with unarmed strikes. Break : This applies a broken bone injury to the defender. Expose : Exposing can only be done to a pinned defender. This makes them helpless to an attacker's ally allowing a kill-shot. Move : This allows the aggressor to move the defender up to half their movement speed. Submission : Holding a defender in a way that will make them faint.

If the defender wins the shatter attempt fails. Shove : This is a standard action in which you push your opponent out of their square into other. The aggressor must make a melee touch attack. This attack uses base attack + Strength or Dexterity, whichever is higher + size modifiers . This provokes an attack of opportunity from the defender.

If the defender winds the shove fails. Trample : This is a full round action in which you run through enemy squares at twice your move speed. The aggressor must make a melee touch attack. This attack uses base attack + Strength or Dexterity, whichever is higher + size modifiers . This provokes an attack of opportunity from the defender.

Any defender that is trampled takes damage equal to the creatures unarmed damage plus twice their strength modifier as crushing damage. Trip Attack : This is an attack action. To initiate a trip attempt, the aggressor must make a melee touch attack. This attack uses the attack bonus of the current attack, not always the highest.

After the attack of opportunity both parties must make opposed strength rolls, size modifiers apply. If the aggressor succeeds, the defender is knocked prone. If the defender succeeds, the trip attempt fails. Size modifiers apply. Note: Attack of opportunity only applies if the aggressor is in the defender's threatened squares.","title":"Combat Rules"},{"location":"combat%20rules/#combat","text":"Combat is when physical altercations need to be resolved.

This will move their turn to that point in the initiative.","title":"Immediate Action"},{"location":"combat%20rules/#combat-actions","text":"Below are the rules for each combat action that can be taken, both advanced and standard. Attack : A normal attack is done by rolling 1d20 + Base Attack Bonus + Strength/Dexterity Mod + size modifiers + other modifiers. It is then compared to the opponents Armor Class (AC). If your attack is equal to or greater than the opponents AC it is considered a hit. Shield Bashing : Shield Bashing is an attack action that can be performed in place of any of your characters attacks. The attack roll is 1d20 + Base Attack of that attack action + Strength or Dexterity (whichever is higher) + any other modifiers. Bucklers do 1d4 damage, Full Shields deal 1d6 damage, and Tower Shields deal 1d10 damage. Ranged Attack : A ranged attack is done by rolling 1d20 + Base Attack + Dexterity + size modifiers + any other modifiers. Like normal attacks it also compares against AC to determine if a hit happens. If in a threatened square this will provoke an attack of opportunity. When shooting through ally squares there is up to a 50% chance you hit your ally by accident depending on how much of the allied square the shot goes through. This is done by ear and there are no hard and fast rules on the percentages. Multiple Attacks : When a character has more than a +5 base attack bonus they gain another attack action at 5 less attack bonus, up to a maximum of four attacks. So if a character's base attack is +11 they get a second attack at +6 and a third attack at +1. This will be shown in charts as +11/+6/+1. This means when attacking the first attack in a round is the most likely to hit, and the last attack is the least. Note: Typically advanced combat maneuvers that are attack actions use the bonus from the attack order. So if a character does a disarm as their second attack. The melee touch attack uses the bonus for the character's second attack. Damage : Damage is rolled after hitting an opponent. Each weapon has it's own die type, which will be listed in the weapon entry. Then you add in strength and other modifiers after the roll. Reckless Fighting : This is an option when attacking to take a -4 dodge penalty to AC and gain a +2 circumstance bonus to damage. Defensive Fighting : This is an option when attacking to take a -4 circumstance penalty to attack and gain a +2 circumstance bonus to AC. Full Defensive Posture : This is a full round action in which your character does not attack, but instead focuses on defending themselves. When in Full Defensive Posture a character gains +4 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex Saves. Melee Touch Attack : This is usually a component to a spell, but it's an attack where armor does not matter since the effect need only make contact. Roll like any ranged attack but the target does not apply any Shield, Parry, Armor, or Natural armor to their AC. Dexterity, Deflection, Dodge, Insight and Luck bonuses still apply. As a special note if a spell requires a melee touch attack, the spell does not provoke an attack of opportunity even if in a threatened square. Weapon Fixation (Unarmed) and its follow up feats, apply to melee touch attacks when rolling to hit. Ranged Touch Attack : This is usually a component to a spell, but it's an attack where armor does not matter since the effect need only make contact. Roll like any ranged attack but the target does not apply any Shield, Parry, Armor, or Natural armor to their AC. Dexterity, Deflection, Dodge, Insight and Luck bonuses still apply. Casting a spell/using an ability : A spell being cast is simply called out, the DM will then check to see if you are in any threatened squares. Once done then the effect of the spell is explained by the player the monster must save against the spell. Please note some spells incorporate an attack, see attack rules above.","title":"Combat Actions"},{"location":"combat%20rules/#advance-combat-maneuvers","text":"There are things that can be done in combat that are a bit more involved than simply rolling an attack and damage. These things tend to have alternate outcomes that allow for the martially minded to control the combat arena a bit more. Much of these attacks work the same way, but will be explained as fully as they can be. Disarm : This is an attack action. To initiate a disarm, the aggressor must have as free hand or a disarming weapon. The aggressor will make a melee touch attack against the defender. This attack uses the attack bonus of the current attack, not always the highest. This provokes an attack of opportunity from the defender. If the defender is successful in dealing damage the aggressor takes a -4 penalty on the following opposed roll. The targets must then make opposed dexterity rolls. If the aggressor succeeds, the defender's weapon drops to the floor in an adjacent square. If the defender succeeds, the attempt fails. Size modifiers apply. Note: Attack of opportunity only applies if the aggressor is in the defender's threatened squares. Feigned Strike : As a standard action your character can chose to do a feigned strike. The opponent must make a level check (1d20 + HD + Wisdom modifier) or discern motive against your bluff roll. If they lose, they will be considered flat-footed for the rest of the round. Grapple : Grabbing another foe and holding onto them is a grapple. This is tone through a few simple steps. This is a standard action. To initiate a grapple attempt, the aggressor must make a melee touch attack. This attack uses base attack + Strength or Dexterity, whichever is higher. This provokes an attack of opportunity from the defender. If the defender is successful in dealing damage the aggressor takes a -4 penalty on the following opposed roll. Next the aggressor and defender make opposed grapple rolls. This will be the grapple modifier on your character sheet. Typically this roll is 1d20 + Highest Base Attack Bonus + Strength + Size modifier. The defender can instead substitute an escape artist for the opposed grapple roll. If the defender wins the grapple fails. If the aggressor wins the opponent is now grappled. At the beginning of every turn the defender can make another opposed grapple (or escape artist) as a free action to try to escape. The defender does not threaten any squares, and is flat footed against every opponent except the aggressor. They cannot move unless the aggressor is the one that moves them. Only weapons considered as unarmed can be used in the grapple. The defender can attack normally with unarmed attacks. The aggressor has a lot of options. Below is a small list of options that the aggressor can do. With the exception of using non-lethal unarmed attacks, all the rest require opposed grapple checks. If the defender succeeds the technique fails, but they remain grappled. Attack with non-lethal unarmed attacks : Attacking can be done normally with unarmed strikes. Break : This applies a broken bone injury to the defender. Expose : Exposing can only be done to a pinned defender. This makes them helpless to an attacker's ally allowing a kill-shot. Move : This allows the aggressor to move the defender up to half their movement speed. Submission : Holding a defender in a way that will make them faint. If successfully held for three rounds the user takes their max HP in non-lethal damage and falls unconscious. If the defender succeeds in an opposed grapple here, the submission is broken, but they are still grappled. Pin : Pinning a defender makes them unable to attack or move, but are not helpless. Charge : This is a full-round action in which your character moves up to twice their movement, and at least 10 ft. of movement, in a straight unobstructed line towards a foe. If they end the move with a target in a threatened square they can make a single attack. During a round where your character charges they gain +2 circumstantial bonus to damage (+4 with a two handed weapon) and -2 circumstantial penalty to AC until the beginning of their next turn. Shatter : This is an attack action made against their opponents weapon. Making a shatter attempt gives the aggressor a -4 circumstance penalty to AC until the beginning of their next turn. The aggressor and defender must roll opposed attacks. This attack uses the attack bonus of the current attack. If the aggressor wins the target's weapon, shield, or armor takes damage. If the defender wins the shatter attempt fails. Shove : This is a standard action in which you push your opponent out of their square into other. The aggressor must make a melee touch attack. This attack uses base attack + Strength or Dexterity, whichever is higher + size modifiers . This provokes an attack of opportunity from the defender. After this both the aggressor and defender must make opposed strength checks. If the aggressor succeeds they push the defender back 5 ft. and up to 5 ft per 5 higher it rolled than the defender. If the defender winds the shove fails. Trample : This is a full round action in which you run through enemy squares at twice your move speed. The aggressor must make a melee touch attack. This attack uses base attack + Strength or Dexterity, whichever is higher + size modifiers . This provokes an attack of opportunity from the defender. After this both the aggressor and defender must make opposed strength checks. If the aggressor succeeds they rune through the defender's square and knock the defender prone. Any defender that is trampled takes damage equal to the creatures unarmed damage plus twice their strength modifier as crushing damage. Trip Attack : This is an attack action. To initiate a trip attempt, the aggressor must make a melee touch attack. This attack uses the attack bonus of the current attack, not always the highest. This provokes an attack of opportunity from the defender. If the defender is successful in dealing damage the aggressor takes a -4 penalty on the following opposed roll. After the attack of opportunity both parties must make opposed strength rolls, size modifiers apply. If the aggressor succeeds, the defender is knocked prone. If the defender succeeds, the trip attempt fails. Size modifiers apply.

With that in mind there are several dozen ways to go about it. It can be purely cosmetic where there are no differences in race/species, it could be mild balanced statistical redistribution, or there could be level adjustments applied and imbalanced statistical distribution applied. With that said it boils down to what the DM would think is most applicable to the world they are building. Whether they go with an entirely constructionist view--where all race/species are balanced, complete essentialist--where the differences are sharp and clearly measurable, or go somewhere in the middle. It is important that the DM be consistent in the choice here though. The examples below will be separated into Mixed, or Essentialist categories. Constructionist will be explained as a rule that applies to all race/species. Terms Hit Dice - Another name for level. Level Gap Increase - This is a rule that applies when a race/species has imbalanced stats/abilities. It will increase the experience required by the equivalent level total. For example \u2014 It normally takes 1,000 experience to go from level 1 to level 2. If a race/species has a gap of +1 it will add the required experience to go from level 2 to level 3 to the gap between level 1 and level 2. So in total it would take 3,000 experience to go from level 1 to level 2 instead of 1,000. Effective Hit Dice - This is the level gap + the character\u2019s Hit Die. This is what is used to determine challenge, experience, rewards, and so on. Always use the effective hit dice of the character. Constructionist - This rule set will only apply the most extreme race/specie differences. Such as size category, number of limbs, and other plainly obvious things. Otherwise anything under this system gets +4 skill points at first level and +1 skill point every level thereafter, and a bonus feat. Mixed - This is a rule set where the physical aspects of the race is inherent, but there are no natural inclinations for behavior, skills, feats, or abilities. There will be attribute balances and uneven ones. Level Gaps do exist in this category but, tend to be low. Essentialist - This rule set is where there are sharp and obvious strength and power differences between races/species. Here you will see strongly suggested alignments. Skill Bonuses, abilities, and often more extreme imbalances in attributes. Often time Level Gaps are higher here than their Mixed example counterparts. Size - the size category of the creature. Small sized are weaker and will off set imbalanced attribute distributions. Large size creatures would inherently gain a level gap due to the benefits of being large. See Size Categories for what this effects. Examples Goblin A short species with a reputation for being unorganized, dirty, and violent. Their skin tones range from dark brown, orange, grey, or green. While the reputation can be unfounded among some tribes, it isn\u2019t among others. Goblins have broad pointy ears, they are a cousin species to elves, though notably shorter. Highly tribal, they divide themselves among clans. Their societal structure tends to be based on who is the strongest/most violent and can hold power over the weaker members of the tribe. Others are more political and organized with a clear system of power, class, and all the whistles and bells of a functioning society. It is no mystery which of these two types live among other sapient species and which doesn\u2019t. Small Sized Heights range from 3\u2019 to 3'8\" examples beyond either threshold are very rare Weight varies a bit more depending on body build. This can range from 30-80 lbs Mixed Attribute Modifications: -2 Strength, +2 Dex, and +2 Intelligence. Goblin Guile : Pick two skills and add a +2 species bonus to them, these will increase for every 3 HD. Essentialist Level Gap: +1 Attribute Modifications: -2 Strength, +2 Dex, and +4 Intelligence. Gain Mechanist Familiar as an ability. +2 to Search, +2 to Disable Device, these will increase by +1 every for every 3 hit dice. Alignment: Neutral Any, they have a semi-lax view on law. Morality is determined by tribe. Human A ubiquitous species known for their charisma and leadership skills. Strong warriors within the species aren\u2019t unheard of, they tend to focus more on strategy, politics, and fame rather than being a warrior species. Like Leonal, due to their shorter lifespan they breed more often. This is why they have large numbers and are so common compared to longer lived species, such as elves and dwarves. Medium size Heights are sexually dimorphic Females range from 4\u201911\u2019\u2019 to 5\u201910\u2019\u2019\u2019 examples beyond either threshold are very rare Males range from 5\u20192\u2019\u2019 to 6\u20198\u2019\u2019 examples beyond either threshold are very rare.

There are also generalist spells which is a list borrowed from all three varieties. Arcane : Drawing from general magical energy arcane spells tend to be flashy and are derived either from a person's knowledge or a person's gumption. Some see it as a science, others an art. Either way, arcane spells tend to be associated with city-folk and their methods of magic. Divine : A deity will use a person as a conduit for their bidding, those favored in this manner have access to divine magic; a gift from their god. This does not mean they need to worship a specific god, a sufficiently fervent person can have multiple deities channeling through them, though the person might not realize who's tool they are. Nature : Those in touch with nature know its ways and its methods and how to use it to an end. Such casters tend to work with the natural world with an empathic understanding of their environment, they are able to shake rocks, control plants, or even become animals themselves. All of these spells derive their effectiveness from a primary mental attribute, or PMA. This will determine the amount of spells per day, or spell slots, the character has. A minimum PMA of 10 + Spell level is needed to cast levels of that level. For example a 5th level spell would need a 15 PMA. PMA : Primary Mental Attribute. These are chosen at character creation and are selected from Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. Once selected it cannot be changed. Certain definitions and abilities have specific PMA requirements. PMA mod : This is the modifier from your primary mental attribute Components [M]: Spell components come in a lot of varieties and are consumed on the use of the spell. Most are very inexpensive and can be assumed purchased when, 'refilling your spell component pouch.' Any component that costs 1 GP or more must be specifically purchased and held within your inventory. Focus [F]: A focus is an object, sometimes required by spells, that helps the caster user their spells. If a focus has 10x the value of a material component, the spell can be cast without the material component. Focuses tend to be staves, orbs, wands, holy symbol, crystals, or anything that is thematic to the caster. A focus must be held in the off-hand or primary hand to be used. Somatic [S]: Most spells have somatic components, which require hand, body, or other kinds of motions. If restricted spells that require somatic components cannot be cast. Verbal [V]: Most spells have verbal components. These are incantations, holy recitations, or other thematic vocalizations. If silenced in anyway spells that requite verbal components cannot be cast. Damage/Healing : A lot of spells deal damage and any spell that has a damage or healing roll involved also ads the PMA modifier at the end. Casting a Spell : Casting a spell is relatively simple your character takes the appropriate actions; immediate, swift, standard, or full-round action and the target of their spell makes a save. It is also possible an attack roll is made for a spell, if so, follow the kind of attack required. Please note a full-round spell finishes at the beginning of the cater's next turn. Spell Resistance : Spell resistance (SR) works like armor class, though it isn\u2019t as easy to obtain. If a spell is subject to spell resistance, and the target has any. Simply roll 1d20 + Caster Level + any other mods you might have to it. Concentration : Concentration refers to a few different things in spell casting. In general, it\u2019s based on the skill Concentration, which is the ability to hold a spell or cast a spell while adverse things are happening. For example: When you cast a spell it provokes an attack of opportunity from anyone who\u2019s threatened squares the caster is in. If hit from that attack a concentration check will need to be made to see if you can cast the spell. Below are circumstances, and their DC, where concentration checks apply. Damaged while casting: DC = Damage Dealt Grappled: DC = 10; opposed grapple needed to even cast Distracted: DC = 15 Casting Defensively: DC = 10 + Spell Level Concentrating/Rage: These have their own rules see their entries. Concentrating : Some spells have a duration labeled as, \"Concentration,\" or \u201cConcentration Max X rounds.\u201d This means you must focus on that spell and cannot cast any other spell or effect that has the duration described as \"Concentration.\" Other standard actions can be taken. If you are struck, grappled, or otherwise distracted while maintaining a concentration spell, you must roll a concentration check. Metamagic : Metamagic is the magic of altering magic. All spell casters can apply the concept to their spells. They can prepare a lower-level spell into a higher-level spell slot and treat that spell as if it were in the higher-level slot for purposes of calculating the spell's DC. There are also feats that create modifications of this. Spell Book Most casters will need a spell book, scroll, or a way of storing spell text. This is because any spell that isn't a known spell has to be prepared at the beginning of the day. A spell book typically costs 10 gp and has 100 pages. A spell takes up as many pages as its spell slot. So a level 1 spell takes up 1 page, while a level 7 spell will take up 7 pages. The only limit to the number of spells a player can have is the number of pages in a spell book, and the amount of spell books they have. Simplex Spells All casters get spells they can cast at their whim. These are spells so simple they take little to no energy to use. In essence, they only do one thing and do not do very much damage or healing overall. Most effects are limited, so when creating these bear this in mind. Simplex spells are divided into Arcane, Divine, Generalist, and Natural and are selectable in accordance with the kind of magic a character can cast. At level up these can always be changed, feats can also be selected to gain further Simplex spells. In general Basic casters have 2, Standard casters have 3, and Advanced casters have 4. Be sure to read notes, as some take a long time to cast despite being simple. All DCs for these spells are 10 + Primary Mental Attribute See full spell list for full spell information, below are summaries Advance Simplex Spells Some definitions allow the use of advanced simplex spells which are more powerful than their standard counterparts.

Weapon Damage types are P (Piercing), B (Bludgeoning), or S (Slashing). Some weapons do two different types of damage, while others can do one or another.

They will also contain other useful pieces of information such as real world examples of these blade types, and bonuses some might have. It is certainly possible to create a fantasy weapon within these categories as well. Concealable Weapons Concealable weapons are weapons that can be easily hidden on a person and gain a +5 circumstance bonus when rolling to conceal said object on a person. They are often light, don't deal a lot of damage, inexpensive, and light. All concealable weapons get 1x strength modifier when dealing damage. Dagger : Tried, true, and broadly encompassing. There are many variations of daggers around the world, though some examples are a baselard, bollock, main gauche, dirk, tanto, and many others. They can be thrown a small distance effectively and are often all around useful to have on a person. While as a weapon it cannot do slashing damage, this is due to lack of heft and good swing-arcs. Daggers can, however, be used to cut ropes, vegetables, and other utility purposes. Blunt Striker : Sometimes the best way to deal with someone is to render them unconscious. The blunt striker covers things like a sap, black jack, cosh, coin sap, or twist jack. They are typically a heavy metallic object inside of a leather sack, or has leather padding around the outside. Traditionally they are a leather pouch with lead shot in it that is sown closed with a handle attached. They deal non-lethal damage and are used to subdue people. Please Note: This is not indicative of real-life and such weapons can more than easily injure or kill a person. Throwing Blade : A throwing star, a hurlbat, and many other objects that have a large bladed surface. This are throwing weapons that do not need a specific point to hit the target, are light and easy to use. When you purchase these they always come in packs of 3, though the weight listed is per throwing blade. Throwing Spike : Harder to use weapons such as a throwing dagger, a shuriken, or other single pointed throwing weapons. These go deeper due to less surface area trying to penetrate a target's skin. When purchased these always come in packs of 3, though weight is listed per throwing spike. Short Sword : These are difficult to define weapons where they are too short to be considered a proper sword, but bladed enough to actually cut. Things in this category would be like a wakasashi, seax knife, kukri, leuku, Filipino espada, and many other types. Bola : A set of heavy weighted balls attached to a rope. They are swung overhead and thrown at a target to trip them from afar. These allow a trip attack at range. When they hit they also do a minor amount of non-lethal damage. One Handed Weapons One handed weapons account for a great deal of weapons of war where a person was also carrying a shield. These weapons are often very difficult to conceal as they are just long enough to stick out of clothing, cause walking problems when stuffed into an outfit, etc. All one-handed weapons get 1x strength modifier when dealing damage. Straight Sword : One of the most ubiquitous weapons in all fantasy settings and in history. Weapon examples of these include a European arming sword, Chinese jian, gladius, Celtic leaf-blade, and many others. Despite some misunderstandings about these blades, they are quite efficient cutters. Curved Sword : Another common type of weapon throughout history due to the forgiving nature of the shape. These weapons don't need to hit at the center of percussion to get the best cutting performance. Examples of these blades throughout history are the khopesh, dao, shamshir, scimitar, messer, kopis and many others. Heavy Sword : A heavy sword is something a bit heftier than the aforementioned blades but can still be held in one hand. Examples of these his history are not common, though a couple of examples would be a dadao or a cutlass. Simple Blunt : Do not mistake the simple part for a lack of lethality. Simple blunt weaponry are extremely devestating to the target of the receiving end. There are an extremely large number of examples, a shillelagh, knobkerrie, mace, billy-club, tonfa, and many others. Pointed Blunt : A bit less common than a simple blunt weapon these would include things such as the flanged mace, morning star and other pointed blunt weapons. Light Axe : An axe with a more slender blade and lighter haft. These would include tomahawks, hand axes, and all things similar. Due to the shape of an axe, they can be used for a trip attempt and gain a +2 circumstance bonus when doing so.

All two handed weapons get 1.5x (round down) strength modifier when dealing damage. Straight Sword : Two handed straight swords were very common in Europe a the blandly name longsword best describes what these are. They are double edge, capable of good cut and thrusting. Curved Sword : Two handed curved blades are also quite common and would include things like a kreigmesser, japanese katana, the two-handed falchion, and much more. Heavy Sword : Sometimes a longsword or kreigmesser just wont cut it, and you need something a whole lot bigger. The montante, greatsword, claymore, nodachi, and other absurdly large swords fit into this category. These are so large they have reach , but do not suffer from the adjacency penalty of a pole weapon. Simple Blunt : A two handed simply blunt would be any hefty two handed blunt weapon. A large hammer, a rock on a stick, a substantial tree branch, or just bigger versions of the one-handed variety. Spiked Blunt : A two handed spiked blunt weapon would be something like a two-handed morning star, an extra heavy mace, a large pick, or a kanabo. Axe : A two handed axe isn't hard to understand. Due to the shape of an axe, they can be used for a trip attempt and gain a +2 circumstance bonus when doing so. Pole Weapons Throughout history pole weapons did the heavy lifting for melee combat in warfare. These weapons range from the extremely simply to the extremely intricate. All of them have a reach advantage over most other melee weapons. Attacks made at the outer most squares are the most effective for a pole weapon. If a target is directly adjacent to a pole wielder the attacks will gain a -4 circumstance penalty to damage. Pole weapons can benefit from the use of a shield as well, but all attacks made while using a shield with a pole weapon gain a -2 circumstance penalty.

Staff : A Staff, stave, quarterstaff, bow staff, wax wood staff, and so on are a type of pole weapon that strikes are done with an empty shaft.

It is hard to beat a pointed stick sometimes, and in all cultures a spear can be found as a primary front line weapon. Hooked Head : Sometimes called a bill-hook or a guisarme, these have a stabbing point at the tip, and a hook on one side of the blade. This allows for thee easy tripping of an opponent, or the yanking of someone off horseback. These weapons can be used to trip at a reach and gain a +2 circumstance bonus to tripping attempts. Bladed Head : This type of pole weapon includes a very large number of weapons. Partisans, halberds, pole axes, guan daos, naginatas, just to name a few. These allow for the delivery of extremely powerful cuts with reach. Tri-point head : These types of weapons have a few points at the tip, a common example of these would be the trident or ranseur. These weapons can do a disarm check at reach and gain a +2 circumstance bonus while Hammer Head : A Pole Hammer has a lot of different names throughout history, they are a blunt and often pointed, head at the end of a pole. The bec de corbin and the lucerne hammer are good examples of these. Ranged Weapons Ranged weapons do not threaten any squares normally. Using a ranged weapon while in a threatened square provokes an attack of opportunity. Firing through ally squares is possible, but you gain a -2 circumstance penalty to attack. If two targets occupy the same square, you have a 50% chance to hit the intended target. Ranged weapons do not gain strength bonus to damage, unless they are masterwork. Short Bow : A smaller bow usable on horse back. Long Bow : A large bow typically used by heavy infantry. Cross Bow : Wooden staffed cross bow that can be hand-drawn.

Any weapon can be used, but if your character is not proficient with it they will suffer a -5 circumstance penalty. On top of this only your strength modifier can be applied, dexterity ceases to be an option. Weapon Groups A martial combat expert is seldom proficient in just a single weapon, but a few to sure up weaknesses while in the field. Below I will list some examples of weapon groups but, these can be created on the fly to suite a character. When making one's own weapon group, do not exceed 4 weapons. A character proficient in a weapon group has full proficiency with all weapons within. Archer : Dagger, One Handed: Curved Sword, Short bow, and Long bow. Berzerker : One Handed: Heavy Sword, One Handed: Heavy Axe, Two Handed: Heavy Sword, and Two Handed: Axe.

They can be thrown a small distance effectively and are often all around useful to have on a person. While as a weapon it cannot do slashing damage, this is due to lack of heft and good swing-arcs. Daggers can, however, be used to cut ropes, vegetables, and other utility purposes. Blunt Striker : Sometimes the best way to deal with someone is to render them unconscious. The blunt striker covers things like a sap, black jack, cosh, coin sap, or twist jack. They are typically a heavy metallic object inside of a leather sack, or has leather padding around the outside.

When purchased these always come in packs of 3, though weight is listed per throwing spike. Short Sword : These are difficult to define weapons where they are too short to be considered a proper sword, but bladed enough to actually cut.

Straight Sword : One of the most ubiquitous weapons in all fantasy settings and in history. Weapon examples of these include a European arming sword, Chinese jian, gladius, Celtic leaf-blade, and many others.

These weapons don't need to hit at the center of percussion to get the best cutting performance. Examples of these blades throughout history are the khopesh, dao, shamshir, scimitar, messer, kopis and many others.

Please refer to the list below for how they work and what they are. General Terminology Weapon Group : These are groups of weapons specified within the above chart for the purposes of feat categories. Examples of this are proficiency feats, focus feats, and specialization feats. As with all things in this set up, this is just a suggested grouping set, though more can be created by working with the DM as needed. Damage : This shows what kind of die to roll for damage rolls. Damage Type : This is the type of damage the weapon deals. Some creatures are resistant to some types of damage. P : Piercing weapon, deals piercing damage. S : Slashing weapon, deals slashing damage. B : Blunt weapon, deals bludgeoning damage. Critical : This shows the critical range and multiplier of a weapon. One Handed Weapon : This is a weapon that can be used in one hand, allowing for the free hand to cast spells or use a shield. Two Handed Weapon : Any weapon that is typically wielded in two hands is a two-handed weapon. Weapons like this typically cannot have a shield equipped at the same time, unless otherwise specified. Spells cannot be cast while wielding a two handed weapon. These kinds of weapons gain a 50% bonus from their strength in damage. For example if your character has a +4 to strength. The bonus to damage will be +6 instead. This bonus only applies if a shield is not being used with a two handed weapon. Reach Weapon : This is a term for a weapon that can attack a set of tiles one step further than adjacent squares. Attacks made at the full distance are at a full attack bonus, while attacks and damage rolls made to enemies in adjacent squares are at a -2 penalty. Thrown Weapon : Thrown weapons are weapons that are thrown at a range. These are counted as ranged attacks for mechanics though they apply 1/2 strength modifier instead of none. Ranged Only : These are weapons that cannot make melee attacks. Masterwork : Masterwork weapons gain a +1 bonus to attack, and an extra 2 base hardness and 5 hp. Masterwork weapons cost 60 gp more than the base cost of the weapon. For weapons that do not have a cost, the masterwork cost will be 60 gp. Composite Bows : Composite bows are crafted as masterwork and require a higher strength to draw, but in turn allow strength mod to be applied to damage. Minimum strength required to pull a composite bow is 14 Technical Weapons Disarming Weapon : These are weapons that are able to make disarm attacks, rather than having to use your hands. For reach weapons this can be done in adjacent or the reach squares. They gain a +2 circumstance bonus when defending from or attempting disarm attacks. Tripping Weapon : These are weapons that are able to make trip attacks, rather than having to use your hands. For reach weapons this can be done in adjacent or reach squares. They gain a +2 circumstance bonus when defending from or initiating trip attacks. Grapple Weapon : This is a weapon that can be used in place of unarmed attacks while in a grapple. Alternate Attack Options Half-Sword : This is a term for gripping the sword by the blade with a leading hand to increase point control. As a free action specify that your character will be half-swording for the round. Gain +2 to all attack rolls in the round and a -4 to all damage. Quillon Strike : This is a term for holding a long sword by the blade and striking with the quillons. All damage becomes bludgeoning and piercing for this attack. It is a move action to re-adjust grip and another move action to change your grip back. While using this form take a -2 penalty to all attacks and outright ignore 2 points of any damage reduction type. Weapon Hardness/HP : Since there are too many weapons here to give individual values the values are recorded in the chart below. Type Hardness HP Light Bladed Weapons 5 5 Long Bladed Weapons 5 10 Wood shafted weapons 2 10 Bows/Crossbows 2 5 Weapon Descriptions Dagger : A simple spike of metal attached to a handle. They are primarily for stabbing and getting into the visor of armor users. Complicated grappling techniques are associated with daggers such as rondel daggers, baselards, and bollock daggers. Any weapon that fits this bill, such as a stiletto, can use the dagger's stats. Long Knife : Sometimes called shortswords these are too short to be an arming sword, but focused on cut and thrust more so than a dagger. These are versatile blades than can be used for a number of applications, quite popular with travelers. Kukri : Popular slashing knives, used to clear brush and reeds with ease, they have a sharp inward curve, sort of like a sickle, and a heavy front. They serve somewhere between a hatchet and a machete. Any front heavy slashing focused blade would use the stats of a kukri. Katar : Sometimes called a punching dagger, the handle is perpendicular to the blade with metal langets on either side to protect the user's arm. If activated these can split into three points and be used to disarm. Arming Sword : The typical blade for self professed heroes, especially in fairy tales. This is a fairly long sword that is wielded with one hand, typically paired with a shield. Much more typically this blade is used by archers as a backup weapon. Any relatively long blade, too long to be a longknife but too short to be used well in two hands would be an arming sword. Khopesh/Sickle : Both of these weapons are different but would have the same effective. A reduced cutting contact surface be it inward curve like a sickle or an outward curve like a khopesh. Both have a hooked shape that is useful for tripping. Longsword : Sometimes called a hand-and-a-half or bastard sword. This is a weapon that describes blades that it is possible to swing one handed but is best used two handed. Bola : Two heave weights tied to a string. These are spun over head and thrown at a targets feet. This weapon simultaneously does damage and a trip attack. Weapon Groups Weapon groups are groups of weapons that fall along the line of training types, roles, and themes. Below will be some examples of weapon groupings, and by no means are all there is. These can be created as needed. Typically they consist of 3-5 Weapons and are named according to the idea of who would use them. When creating them keep the concept of the group's user in mind. Work with your GM on the matter and see if they have input. Most feats that enhance weapons will enhance groups at the more general level. Archer : Short bow, Longbow, Arming Sword and Dagger Ranger : Short Bow, Longsword, Tomahawk, and War Axe Berserker : Greatsword, Battle Axe, Hurlbat, and Battle Mace Druid : Sickle, Long Knife, Short bow, Atlatl and Sling. Infantry : Spear, Bill, Arming Sword, War Hammer, and Heavy Mace. Militiaman : Stave, Longknife, Kreigmesser, Shortbow, and War Scythe. Guard : Light Mace, Longbow, Halberd, and Ranseur Mage : Arming Sword, Long Knife, Heavy Macy, Sickle, and Handaxe Scout : Sling, Short bow, Longbow, Throwing Dagger, and Long Knife Swordsman : Long Knife, Kreigmesser, Longsword, Greatsword and Tuck Wanderer : Kukri, Long Knife, Stave, and Short bow Kobold Essentials : Short Bow, Spear, Dagger, Long Knife, War Pick Kobold Warrior : Atlatl, Ranseur, Arming Sword, War Axe, War Hammer Hunter : Spear, Atlatl, Longsword, Longknife, Huntsman Axe Wanderlust : Longbow, Unarmed, Stave, Dagger and Hurlbat Salt Outrider : Bolas, Spear, Shortbow, pole hammer, long knife Weapon Proficiency When creating your character, the progression chart you choose determines how many weapons your character is proficient with. When you are proficient with a weapon all features function as you would expect. If your character is not proficient with a weapon they receive a -2 penalty in the use of the weapon, cannot make full round attacks with the weapon, cannot use any of the secondary features of a weapon -- such as half-sword -- and they cannot fight defensively in any capacity with the weapon. Typically to gain proficiency a character needs the, \"Weapons Training (Weapon Group,)\" feat. Which is obtained whenever a feat or bonus feat is gained.

Using a weapon is done by Rolling a 1d20 and adding Base Attack Bonus+ Strength or Dexterity (Whichever is higher) + Any other modifiers to attack. If your base attack bonus has a / then a number after it that means during a round you get a second attack, third, etc... Below is a chart of weapons organized by specialization groupings.

Please refer to the list below for how they work and what they are.","title":"Weapon Terms"},{"location":"weapons_old/#general-terminology","text":"Weapon Group : These are groups of weapons specified within the above chart for the purposes of feat categories. Examples of this are proficiency feats, focus feats, and specialization feats. As with all things in this set up, this is just a suggested grouping set, though more can be created by working with the DM as needed. Damage : This shows what kind of die to roll for damage rolls. Damage Type : This is the type of damage the weapon deals. Some creatures are resistant to some types of damage. P : Piercing weapon, deals piercing damage. S : Slashing weapon, deals slashing damage. B : Blunt weapon, deals bludgeoning damage. Critical : This shows the critical range and multiplier of a weapon. One Handed Weapon : This is a weapon that can be used in one hand, allowing for the free hand to cast spells or use a shield. Two Handed Weapon : Any weapon that is typically wielded in two hands is a two-handed weapon. Weapons like this typically cannot have a shield equipped at the same time, unless otherwise specified. Spells cannot be cast while wielding a two handed weapon. These kinds of weapons gain a 50% bonus from their strength in damage. For example if your character has a +4 to strength. The bonus to damage will be +6 instead. This bonus only applies if a shield is not being used with a two handed weapon. Reach Weapon : This is a term for a weapon that can attack a set of tiles one step further than adjacent squares. Attacks made at the full distance are at a full attack bonus, while attacks and damage rolls made to enemies in adjacent squares are at a -2 penalty. Thrown Weapon : Thrown weapons are weapons that are thrown at a range. These are counted as ranged attacks for mechanics though they apply 1/2 strength modifier instead of none. Ranged Only : These are weapons that cannot make melee attacks. Masterwork : Masterwork weapons gain a +1 bonus to attack, and an extra 2 base hardness and 5 hp. Masterwork weapons cost 60 gp more than the base cost of the weapon. For weapons that do not have a cost, the masterwork cost will be 60 gp. Composite Bows : Composite bows are crafted as masterwork and require a higher strength to draw, but in turn allow strength mod to be applied to damage. Minimum strength required to pull a composite bow is 14","title":"General Terminology"},{"location":"weapons_old/#technical-weapons","text":"Disarming Weapon : These are weapons that are able to make disarm attacks, rather than having to use your hands. For reach weapons this can be done in adjacent or the reach squares. They gain a +2 circumstance bonus when defending from or attempting disarm attacks. Tripping Weapon : These are weapons that are able to make trip attacks, rather than having to use your hands. For reach weapons this can be done in adjacent or reach squares. They gain a +2 circumstance bonus when defending from or initiating trip attacks. Grapple Weapon : This is a weapon that can be used in place of unarmed attacks while in a grapple.","title":"Technical Weapons"},{"location":"weapons_old/#alternate-attack-options","text":"Half-Sword : This is a term for gripping the sword by the blade with a leading hand to increase point control. As a free action specify that your character will be half-swording for the round. Gain +2 to all attack rolls in the round and a -4 to all damage. Quillon Strike : This is a term for holding a long sword by the blade and striking with the quillons. All damage becomes bludgeoning and piercing for this attack. It is a move action to re-adjust grip and another move action to change your grip back. While using this form take a -2 penalty to all attacks and outright ignore 2 points of any damage reduction type. Weapon Hardness/HP : Since there are too many weapons here to give individual values the values are recorded in the chart below.

They are primarily for stabbing and getting into the visor of armor users. Complicated grappling techniques are associated with daggers such as rondel daggers, baselards, and bollock daggers. Any weapon that fits this bill, such as a stiletto, can use the dagger's stats. Long Knife : Sometimes called shortswords these are too short to be an arming sword, but focused on cut and thrust more so than a dagger. These are versatile blades than can be used for a number of applications, quite popular with travelers. Kukri : Popular slashing knives, used to clear brush and reeds with ease, they have a sharp inward curve, sort of like a sickle, and a heavy front. They serve somewhere between a hatchet and a machete. Any front heavy slashing focused blade would use the stats of a kukri. Katar : Sometimes called a punching dagger, the handle is perpendicular to the blade with metal langets on either side to protect the user's arm. If activated these can split into three points and be used to disarm. Arming Sword : The typical blade for self professed heroes, especially in fairy tales. This is a fairly long sword that is wielded with one hand, typically paired with a shield. Much more typically this blade is used by archers as a backup weapon. Any relatively long blade, too long to be a longknife but too short to be used well in two hands would be an arming sword. Khopesh/Sickle : Both of these weapons are different but would have the same effective. A reduced cutting contact surface be it inward curve like a sickle or an outward curve like a khopesh. Both have a hooked shape that is useful for tripping. Longsword : Sometimes called a hand-and-a-half or bastard sword. This is a weapon that describes blades that it is possible to swing one handed but is best used two handed. Bola : Two heave weights tied to a string. These are spun over head and thrown at a targets feet. This weapon simultaneously does damage and a trip attack.","title":"Weapon Descriptions"},{"location":"weapons_old/#weapon-groups","text":"Weapon groups are groups of weapons that fall along the line of training types, roles, and themes. Below will be some examples of weapon groupings, and by no means are all there is. These can be created as needed. Typically they consist of 3-5 Weapons and are named according to the idea of who would use them. When creating them keep the concept of the group's user in mind. Work with your GM on the matter and see if they have input. Most feats that enhance weapons will enhance groups at the more general level. Archer : Short bow, Longbow, Arming Sword and Dagger Ranger : Short Bow, Longsword, Tomahawk, and War Axe Berserker : Greatsword, Battle Axe, Hurlbat, and Battle Mace Druid : Sickle, Long Knife, Short bow, Atlatl and Sling.

When you are proficient with a weapon all features function as you would expect. If your character is not proficient with a weapon they receive a -2 penalty in the use of the weapon, cannot make full round attacks with the weapon, cannot use any of the secondary features of a weapon -- such as half-sword -- and they cannot fight defensively in any capacity with the weapon. Typically to gain proficiency a character needs the, \"Weapons Training (Weapon Group,)\" feat. Which is obtained whenever a feat or bonus feat is gained. Some progressions offer individual weapon proficiency or an entire group.","title":"Weapon Proficiency"},{"location":"Abilities/","text":"Abilities Terms Abilities Abilities are generally supernatural(Su) or extraordinary(Ex) tools a character has. Oftentimes they bring something completely new to the table that isn't available as a spell or feat. Oftentimes they follow a theme with several iterations on the same ability. Concentration If an ability requires concentration treat it as a 5th level spell for purposes of calculating the concentration DC. Difficulty Check (DC) Some abilities require a target make a save, and for that there will be a difficulty check. These come in two flavors. Mental based(Su) and Constitution based(Ex). They are often calculated as 10 + 1/2 HD + primary mental modifier or 10 + 1/2 HD + constitution modifier respectively. Dispel Magic Any ability that is a supernatural ability(Su) can be subject to dispel magic if specified. If this is the case use your HD as your caster level. Extraordinary Ability (Ex) These are abilities that typically rely on physical attributes and are more mundane in their presentation. These are never subject to dispel magic or spell resistance. Hit Die (HD) Your character's level after any level adjustments. Iterative Growth When a higher form of an ability is taken it replaces the previous ability. For example Improved Breath Weapon replaces Breath Weapon. Prerequisites There are prerequisites for these, the ability score requirements are a hard prerequisite. However, other prerequisites can be overridden with sufficient integration with the character's back story. Spell Proficiency Spell proficiency is added to Spells, spell-like abilities(Sp), supernatural abilities(Su) DC's, as well as any non-touch attack roll. It is also applied as a flat bonus for each damage/healing/warding dice for Spells, Spell-like abilities(Sp), or Supernatural Abilities(Su). For example, if a character has a spell that deals 5d6 damage and has a Casting Proficiency of 2 it will be 5d6+10 damage. Spell Resistance If an ability is subject to spell resistance your HD is your effective caster level. Note that spell penetration does not benefit abilities. Super Natural Ability (Su) These are abilities that typically rely on mental attributes and are more magical in their presentation. They are subject to dispel magic, and sometimes spell resistance.

These types include Slashing, Piercing, Bludgeoning, and Crushing. Damage reduction is applied to all attacks in a round. If your character gets hit 5 times, they apply the damage reduction once for each hit. Damage reduction is notated by the value reduced / what penetrates it. For example 15/silver will reduces 15 damage from every hit, unless it comes from a source made of silver. If the damage reduction is noted 5/- this will mitigate 5 damage from any physical source of damage. Delusion Delusions only affect the target creature(s). Anything that helps defend against mind-affecting spells also applies to delusions. Figments can fool the senses enough to make someone hurt themselves in the process of dealing with it. Difficult Terrain Sometimes an area is difficult to traverse for one of many reasons. In these areas a character moves at half speed. Disposition Disposition is the opinion and willingness of a character to listen to another character. There are a lot of skills that are affected by disposition. If someone likes you they are easier to convince, fool, or work with in general. If the skill is being used on an NPC the DM will silently add or subtract modifiers based on the NPCs disposition. See the chart below for how the bonuses work. If you are working to improve disposition with a character this is best done through in game action or by the DM setting an DC and applying the current disposition modifier. Roll Modifier by Target's Disposition Hostile Hateful Dislike Apprehensive Neutral Warmly Liked Respectful Adoring -50 -15 -10 -5 0 +5 +10 +15 +50 Exertion An exertion is a standard action that reduces the remaining duration of a spell or ability effect to an instantaneous duration. In turn there are often damage or other affects detailed in the entry. Energy charge is a good example of this. Figment A figment is a type of illusion that creates an effect in the world that everyone can see. These types of illusions are not subject to anything that makes a person interacting with the figment immune to mind affecting spells. Figments can trick all of the sense, and are not just visual. Holy/Unholy Anything that is holy/unholy will bypass any damage reduction of the corresponding type. Unholy things deal an extra 1d10 damage to living things while Holy will do the same for undead things. Known Spell A known spell is a spell a character understand inherently and does not need to prepare it at the beginning of the day. It can be used in place of any prepared spell at any time, so long as they have spell slots remaining for the day. Any magic caster will have some known spells, characters with the wizardry primary definition gain an entire school of known spells. Line of Effect Line of effect is a term used to describe when you would normally be able to affect something. You have line of effect to a creature if you could throw a ball at them and hit them. Please note, this does not mean a player or monster blocks line of effect, but a wall or large object would. Natural Attack, Primary Natural attacks do not follow the standard attack for a weapon wielding characters. Instead a creature with natural attacks will have a number of attacks determined by the species or monster entry. It is possible to get natural attacks from spells. Primary natural attacks are done at the character's/creature's highest base attack bonus + strength modifier or dexterity modifier (whichever is higher) + any other bonuses they might have. If they have more than one primary attack, all of them are done at the highest attack bonus the character/creature has. Natural Attack, Secondary Secondary natural attacks are any non-primary special attack. They are at -5 from the highest base attack instead of being the full. Damage done by these attacks will deal a bit less as they can only apply half of the user's strength mod. Reach Reach weapons are weapons that threaten another 5 ft. worth of squares around them for a medium size creature. A reach weapon with a small size creature minus the far corners. Rest Period A rest period is any significant amount of down time in which a character and get at least 6 hours of sleep, meditation, preparation, or other types of down-time activities. If a character sleeps or meditates they will recover their HD x constitution modifier in HP as well as 1 point of attribute damage across all attributes.

Instead of magical items though most creatures should have their base stats modified to match or exceed the average player's stats at that point. Terms Bonded Armor : Bonded armor is armor that simulates the stats of the kind of armor a character would wear, but is fused with the creature. This is most common in constructs, elementals, and attendants. Bonded armor cannot be looted, as it is either fused to, part of, or otherwise bonded to the creature. Natural Attack : Natural attacks are things like claws, fangs, wings, tails, etc. Typically a monster has a primary, often claws or a bite, that has the highest bonus. All other natural attacks are at a -5 bonus during a full round attack. On any full-round attack, a monster uses ALL of its natural attacks. If they cannot full-attack they will typically opt for their primary natural weapon. Weapon focus (Unarmed), and its counterpart feats, apply to all natural weapons. Definitions Much like making a character, the first thing we need to do is pick a primary creature definition for the monster.
