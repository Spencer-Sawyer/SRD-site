This idea was born from having played several table top systems and finding the purely open-class character systems lacking in flavor, and the closed-class system games always missing the mark on how a character is imagined. Instead of a system writing a character's history into its base abilities, a person should be able to choose exactly how their character is; without being flat and bland like a completely open-class system is. Rule Zero Like most table top systems there will be one person building and running a campaign setting and story. Throughout the explanations and examples, the setting of Estrella will be used. Any and all of these rules and examples can and should be modified to suit a group's specific desires and needs. Little effort will be given into balancing this system as the idea is more about having fun, telling stories, and allowing character growth arcs to enrich the player experience. If a player is making things unfun, it is suggested that the person running the group (or the group as a whole) address the complaints with that player. This is especially true if a player is building something that comes off as overpowering or condescending. The Definition Master (DM) has the ultimate word in how something should happen. It is suggested that discussion with the group happen first, so it doesn't feel dictatorial. Example Setting The Setting given in all the example, as said earlier, is called Estrella. It is a meritocratic and isolated nation located in the southern hemisphere of its base world.

They introduce flavor and intrigue into how a character is. These can be taken at any time willingly by a player unless specified in the description. Afflictions can also be bestowed on a character either through massive damage, curses, or other means through the course of a campaign. Most of these effects are permanent unless removed with a break-enchantment spell, in the case of magically induced ones; or a Cure Affliction spell/effect. Temporary effects often turn into a permanent effect. You will see mention of conditions in other pages, those are similar to afflictions but always self correct and last for very limited amounts of time. Types There are several types of afflictions and their chances which can be cured, how, or if they can even be cured at all. All afflictions can be applied from a spell, in which case their type because Curse. Refer to the list below for more information Curse - These are bestowed with the \"Bestow Curse\" Spell any non-wound affliction can be applied to a target with this spell.

Disease - Any affliction caused by pathogens, magical or otherwise, fall into this category. This does not include diseases that stem from a person's own body. When a disease is given, pick the appropriate disease based afflictions and apply them all. A good example of a disease would be Influenza (which would fall under Sickly - Respiratory) Genetic - These are taken at character creation, and cannot be cured with anything less than a wish spell. A Genetic affliction is part of the character's design. These typically would take the form of auto-immune disease, genetic disorders, and other things that the body does poorly. When a Genetic affliction is chosen, pick the appropriate afflictions and apply them all. A good example would be Sarcoidosis (All three \u201cSickly\u201d afflictions and Bad Joints). Injury - When a wound becomes permanent it is an injury. Some things bypass the wound category and go straight into injury. Injuries require time to recover but can be healed with non-magical means. A good example is a broken leg that was set wrong. Heal Skill DCs are specific to the injury, some require surgery. Wound - After a critical hit there is a 20% chance to get a wound. A wound is a temporary affliction that has a 50% chance to become an Injury if not healed. All wound heal DCs are equal to 10 + affected character's HD - Con Mod. This also required the use of a Wound-Binding Kit. A good example of a wound would be an arrow through the knee.

Within Estrella they are food producers, both honey and fruits primarily. Small-sized This species lacks sexual dimorphism in height and weight Males of this species are slightly more vibrant and tend to have an iridescent band of color on their wings, while the females are matte grey in the same location. They average 2'9'' to 3'7'' in height and weigh between 35-70 lbs.

Despite having such a different culture from the rest of Estrella, they are fiercely loyal to the republic. Medium Sized This species lacks sexual dimorphism Members of this species lack obvious primary and secondary sex characteristics. It is difficult to discern the sex of a Varankin without physical examination, which is considered quite rude. They average 6'4' to 7'3\" Weights range from 350-500 lbs, and typically are quite lithe at these weights due to high muscle density. Creation Information Attribute Modifications: +2 Str, -2 Cha Natural Armor +2 Special : Swim Speed 30 ft, gain a bonus feat at first level Custom Always be willing to build a custom race with any player should they desire it. Typically the patterns are Ability scores +4, -2, and some sort of progression bonus. e.g. A bonus feat, bonus skill points, an extra ability, or extra definitions. Sometimes the ability scores will be less due to extra features; like flying or natural armor. Other times extra bonuses are also given, like dark vision, but this is underwhelming enough not to reduce another bonus. Elf Elves in Estrella have a longer view of history and knowledge of the culture, rather than their fast-lived countrymen. Typically occupying positions in cultural institutions they try to guide the arts, philosophies, and principles of the country with a gentle, if not condescending, touch. Elves are very rarely found outside of cities and balk at the idea of living in planes, deserts, or mountains.

The grand majority of technological development in the past century has stemmed out of the goblin cities found within The Rim. They are a matriarchal society, sort of. The region is run democratically and does send representatives to the Estrella senate. These tend to be highly astute females, as their culture tends to value beautiful goblins over all else. As the saying goes, \"Goblin men think with the wrong head.\" Creation Information Small Sized Heights range from 3\u2019 to 3'8\" examples beyond either threshold are very rare Weight varies a bit more depending on body build. This can range from 55-80 lbs Attribute Modifications : -2 Strength, +2 Dex, and +2 Intelligence.

Below the details on how monsters, dragons, animals, constructs and so, are created. Terms Natural Attack : Natural attacks are things like claws, fangs, wings, tails, ect. Typically a monster has a primary, often claws or a bite, that has the highest bonus. All other natural attacks are at a -5 bonus during a full round attack.

School All spells are divided into schools, these are a broad view of how the spell functions. They can be broken into several types as seen here. Abjuration : These are spells the provide protection from both the mundane and the arcane, as well as general anti-magic type spells. Those that primarily practice this school are called Interdictors. Compulsion This school is composed of spells that forcefully coerce others into action or inaction, be it for or against their own goals. Those that primarily practice this school are called Coercers. Conjuration : These are spells where a physical thing is created, be it a glob of acid, an elemental, or a floating sword. Often times these spells have to bypass the AC of the target rather than require a save. Those that practice this school are called Summoners. Divination : These are spells that grant the caster, or others, some form of insight. This would including scrying, seeing invisibility, predictive thoughts, and other types of similar effects. Those that primarily practice this school are called Seers. Evocation : These are spells that call flashes of energy to destroy things. This is typically limited to Acid, Fire, Ice, Force, and Sonic energies. These spells tend to require a save instead of a roll against a target's AC. Those that primarily practice this school are called War Mages. Illusion : These are spells that convince the senses of others that the unreal, is real. Those that primarily practice this school are called Illusionists. Thaumaturgy : These are spells that have control over positive and negative energy. As well as things themed around life and death. Those that primarily practice Thaumaturgy are called Vivimancers or Necromancers depending on preference. Transmutation : These are spells that modify a subject's capabilities, or modify a physical object. Those that primarily practice transmutation are called Engineers. Spell Proficiency Spell proficiency is added to Spells, Spell-like abilities(Sp), or Supernatural Abilities(Su) DC and any non-touch attack roll. It is also applied as a flat bonus for each damage/healing/warding dice for Spells, Spell-like abilities(Sp), or Supernatural Abilities(Su).

Oftentimes they bring something completely new to the table that isn't available as a spell or feat. Oftentimes they follow a theme with several iterations on the same ability. Hit Die (HD): Your character's level after any level adjustments. Difficulty Check (DC): Some abilities require a target make a save, and for that there will be a difficulty check. These come in two flavors. Mental based(Su) and Constitution based(Ex). They are calculated as follows 10 + 1/2 HD + primary mental modifier or 10 + 1/2 HD + constitution modifier. This will be determined in the ability itself Dispel Magic : Any ability that is a supernatural ability(Su) can be subject to dispel magic if specified. If this is the case use your HD as your caster level. Concentration : If an ability requires concentration treat it as a 5th level spell for purposes of calculating the concentration DC. Spell Resistance : If an ability is subject to spell resistance your HD is your effective caster level. Note that spell penetration does not benefit abilities. Iterative Growth : When a higher form of an ability is taken it replaces the previous ability. For example Improved Breath Weapon replaces Breath Weapon. Prerequisites : There are prerequisites for these, the ability score requirements are a hard prerequisite. However, other prerequisites can be overridden with sufficient integration with the character's back story. Ally Shielding (Ex) Prerequisite : PMA 14 Use : 1 + 1 per 4 HD per day Action : Standard action Target : 30 ft radius centered on the user Duration : 1 round per HD A strong defense allows for a more hearty offense they say. Allies are warded equal to the user's HD x PMA Modifier. This bonus applies to the targets as a whole. So if the caster has 40 warding the warding damage is taken before any HP damage is taken. Damage taken by anyone inside the radius reduces the whole ward's HP. Animal Companion Prerequisite : Character must not have a familiar or construct Effect : Gain an animal companion, the creature's type must be animal. This creature will gain HD as you gain HD, as well as the bonuses listed below. An animal always has 3 or less intelligence. Roll stats for your companion like you would a character or use the pre-rolled 18, 16, 14, 14, 12, 3; as your stats. Like player races, some animals get bonuses to certain stats, see the specific animal entry for information. Devotion: If you are injured, crippled, or unconscious, your animal companion will either try to carry you away from danger, or defend your body by occupying your square against other attackers. While your animal companion is defending you, you cannot be finished off with an attack. Animals that can carry you away will prioritize that unless cornered. Character HD Natural Armor Adj. Str/Dex Adj. Special 1st - 2nd +0 +1 Link, share spells 3rd - 4th +2 +1 Evasion 5th - 6th +3 +2 Devotion 7th - 8th +4 +2 Improved Bull Rush 9th - 10th +5 +3 - 11th - 12th +6 +3 Improved Evasion 13th -14th +7 +4 - 15th - 16th +8 +4 Improved Overrun 17th - 18th +9 +5 - 19th - 20th +10 +5 - Natural Armor Adjustment: This bonus is in addition to whatever base natural armor the creature has. So if it has a base of +2 then at level 20 the total natural armor of the creature will be +12. This stacks with Natural Armor Enhancement bonuses. Arcane Blast (Su) [Magic] Prerequisite : PMA 16+ Use : 1 + 1 per 6 HD per day Action : Full Round Range : Long (250 ft + 25 ft per HD) Target : Single Target Duration : Instant Saving Throw : Fortitude half; Reflex half, see rules DC : PMA Based Spell Resistance : No Your character accumulates a large amount of arcane energy and releases it in a powerful burst on a single target within range. This target must make a Fortitude Save DC = 10 + 1/2 HD + PMA for half damage. Any targets within 10 ft of the primary target must make a reflex save of the same DC or take damage equal to half the base damage rolled against the primary target. As a note the caster can choose to not have it explode. This attack deals 1d10 force damage per caster level. A spell slot of 5th level or higher can be sacrificed to enable a secondary effect on the blast: Stun : Stun's primary target for 1 round/spell slot level if fortitude save is failed Knock Back : pushes target back 5 ft/spell slot level if fortitude save is failed Recover : Heal caster for 1d6/spell slot level Regenerative Ward : Ward caster for PMA x spell slot level for rounds equal to 1 per 2 CL.

Hit Die (HD): Your character's level after any level adjustments. Difficulty Check (DC): Some abilities require a target make a save, and for that there will be a difficulty check. These come in two flavors. Mental based(Su) and Constitution based(Ex). They are calculated as follows 10 + 1/2 HD + primary mental modifier or 10 + 1/2 HD + constitution modifier. This will be determined in the ability itself Dispel Magic : Any ability that is a supernatural ability(Su) can be subject to dispel magic if specified.

The type chosen for your character should be based on their strength first, as heavier armor weighs a lot more, then maximum dexterity mod. It is best to run with an armor that caters to the maximum allowable dexterity modifier to AC. Armor Bonus This is the base armor bonus for the armor and is added to the AC of the character Maximum Dexterity This is the limit to how much of your character's dexterity modifier can be applied to armor class. A character with a +4 to dexterity wearing full plate would not be able to apply any of that bonus to AC, but it would apply to other things such as attacks, skills, and saves. Weight Weight here is figuring in the approximate weight for these classes of armor, the weight of the undergarment, which is a gambeson, is figured in. Movement Modifier This is the penalty taken to movement speed. So if the armor has -5 and your character has movement of 30; your character's movement would be 25 with that armor on. Check Penalty Check penalties are the negatives taken to skills that require movement, like climb, swim, tumble, etc.. While wearing the armor, or having a shield in your inventory, these penalties apply. Please note having a shield in some sort of pocket dimension like a magical bag will remove the penalty. Masterwork Damage Reduction This is damage reduction that is gained when the armor is Masterwork. This bonus stacks with any character growth based damage reduction or armor enhancement based reduction. So from feats, applicable abilities, or definitions. This damage reduction will not stack with any spell derived damage reduction. Masterwork Masterwork armor is a higher quality build of whatever the root armor is. On top of gaining the masterwork damage reduction listed in the chart, the armor's weight is also reduced by 5 lbs, the check penalty is reduced by 1, and the movement modifier is reduced by 5. A masterwork armor costs 30 go more than the base cost. Masterwork increases the base hardness by 2 and HP by 10 Masterwork shields are made from higher quality materials and are often crafted better. Masterwork shields have their check penalties reduced by 1 and costs 30 gp more than the base price.

Light armor has a 15% spell failure chance, Medium armor has a 30% spell failure chance, and heavy armor has a 50% spell failure chance. This failure chance only applies if the spell is arcane and requires somatic components. Divine and Nature spells are not affected by this as the somatic components are far simpler. Descriptions Gambeson : A thick coat of layered linen and wool. Sometimes simple, sometimes rather stylish. It provides far more protection than one would expect and is the base component of all the other armors. This armor has a base hardness of 2 and 10 hit points. Light Chain : This is a gambeson with a simple chain, ring, or scale shirt over the torso with a belt to help distribute its weight. It provides superior protection. This armor has a base hardness of 5 and 15 hit points. Light Plate : This is a gambeson with light plating in important areas, while not providing the best protection it is light and mobile. This armor has a base hardness of 5 and 20 hit points. Medium Hide/Bone : This is a fuller set of armor with padded pants and thick tough hide, typically leather boiled in fat and oil, or bone. It provides decent protection. This is popular among druids This armor has a base hardness of 2 and 25 hit points. Medium Chain : A fuller set of armor with padded pants and full set of chain, scales, or metal banding. that covers the majority of the body. It provides decent protection. This armor has a base hardness of 5 and 30 hit points. Medium Plate : Sometimes called a half or partial plate this armor includes heavier plating in all vital areas and chain where it doesn't have plating. It provides good protection at the cost of mobility. This armor has a base hardness of 5 and 40 hit points. Heavy Dragonhide : This is armor made from the hide of tough magical monster, sometimes but not always a dragon. It naturally has scales and tough rigid sections to it. When molded properly and fit on it provides good protection and is more mobile than heavier armors. This armor has a base hardness of 2 and 40 hit points. Heavy Chain : A full on suit with Chain and metal banding or scales in important spots this provides heavy protection while still allowing for some extra movements. This armor has a base hardness of 5 and 45 hit points. Heavy Plate : Fit to your character are a series of articulated plates that allow for the fullest range of motions such a suit could offer.

Full Shield : A full shield, center grip or arm grip, provides much more protection to the user and utility in shield bashes, see combat than a buckler does. This offers a +1 circumstance bonus to reflex saves against area spells, so long as it isn't centered on your character. This shield has a base hardness of 5 and 25 hit points. Full Shields can be used with any non-ranged two-handed weapon. Tower Shield : A large shield that is cumbersome and unwieldy when not in use. These offer the best protection, especially while in formation with other soldiers. If readied against any directional area spell or at the epicenter of a radial Area spell it can completely prevent damage to the user and the square directly behind them. This does force the shield to take the damage. Against any selected attacker, they gain full concealment against ranged attacks, once more the shield will take the damage instead of your character if the attack/spell hits.

This is done through a turn based system in which dice are rolled to determine the outcome of such a conflict. The following rules will explain how to do this and all the nuance involved. Basics Health Points (HP) Your character has a number a health points that represent their current condition in combat. Lose HP doesn't necessarily mean that they've been cut or hit but just a decrease in their overall stamina to fight. HP is determined by a character's chosen progression chart and their constitution. When damage is taken it is subtracted from your current HP total. If your character's HP reaches 0 they fall unconscious and gain an injury. From here follow the rules on death. Hit points recover at a rate of Constitution modifier x Hit Dice per day without medical treatment. Non-Lethal Damage (NLD) Your character can take hits and affects that are intended to render them unconscious. When NLD is taken it is added to the character starting from 0. If your character's NLD is equal to or greater than your character's current HP total, they faint. NLD heals at a rate five times faster than HP. Death Your character has hit 0 HP and is now wounded. To die your character needs to fail 3 death-saves (see options below). If they are hit by an opponent during this time, it is considered instant death. If your character has taken enough damage from a single hit to equal one-half their HP, and it reduces them to zero, they are counted as having failed 2 death-saves. If they take damage equal to their HP total and are reduced to zero, it is considered instant death. Death-saves can be done in several ways. Check below for options that best suite your group. In Death, all are equal : Roll a d% and if the number is 51 or higher it is a save. If it is 50 or lower, it is a fail Stats matter! : A fortitude save must be made. DC is equal to 10 + Character Hit Dice - Constitution modifier. Brutality : A fortitude save must be made. DC is equal to 10 + damage dealt that dropped your character to 0. Initiative Roll Start combat with an initiative roll. This should be done by rolling 1d20 and adding your character's initiative bonus to the roll. If there is a conflict of two rolls being the same, have the conflicting characters roll against each other and arrange them by high to low before slotting them into your initiative order. As a suggested rule, divide your bonus by 100 and add it to the end as a decimal to help reduce the amount of initiative conflicts. Example: 1d20+8 with a roll of 12 would be 20.08* Combat Round A combat round is when all of the turns have been taken and the current initiative order is back at the top. The duration of a combat round is approximately 6 seconds. Space Space is the amount of squares a character takes up. For most characters this will by 5 ft., or one square. Please note, small characters take up 5 ft as well. Reach Reach is how many squares a character threatens. Medium and Small size creatures with non-reach weapons threaten all adjacent squares. Smaller than small size must occupy the same square as an opponent. If a medium size creature has a reach weapon their reach expands out another set of squares out. A small size creature using a reach weapon does the same, but loses the corners of the larger square. Diagram Pending Size Modifiers For many combat maneuvers size effects the opposing rolls made between two creatures. As a result, creatures smaller than medium take a -4 penalty for every size category smaller than medium. Creatures larger than medium gain a +4 bonus for every size category above medium. Opposed Rolls For advanced combat maneuvers they will often make mention of opposed rolls. These are rolls where the aggressor and defender during a maneuver must roll against each other. whichever of the two rolls highers is the winner. Turn and Actions A character's turn is broken down into action types, things here can get a bit granular. Primarily a turn is broken into a move action, a standard action, free actions, and a swift action should they have any. A standard action can instead be replaced with a character's attack action(s). Move Action A move action is typically limited to readying a weapon, moving up to your character's movement. Most move actions provoke attacks of opportunity, a feature explained later. In place of a move action a *five-foot step* can be taken in its place, which provokes no attacks of opportunity. Standard Action A standard action is something that takes more thought and energy, such as lighting a lantern, casting a spell, using abilities, and so on. If something is labeled as a standard action, it takes the entire standard action to do it. Your character's standard action can be given up for another move action, but not vice-versa. In place of standard actions a character can instead take all of its attack actions. Most characters start with one attack action, though as their base attack bonus increases the number of attack actions will increase. This will be denoted in the attack curve chart as +x/+y/+z... when there is a slash and a number that tells you the base attack bonus used with that attack. If your character has three attacks, they can get three attack actions in a round. Please note if attack actions are used, no standard actions can be taken. Free Action A free action is something that can be done with little to no thought and at the same time as other actions. This would include speaking, grabbing something from a readily available place on the character's person, drawing a weapon while moving, and whatever else might fit. No two free actions can be the same action, but a character is allowed as many free actions as they can use. Swift Action A swift action, sometimes called a bonus action, are actions that can occur with everything else happening. These are often spells or abilities, rarely any kind of physical or martial combat maneuver. If a spell or ability is labeled as a swift action, it is one. A character can only use a single swift action per round. Full Round Action A full round action takes the entire round, so it begins on a characters turn, and ends at the beginning of the next character's turn. This means the character on the following term can act normally again. No move, swift, standard or immediate actions can take place during a Full Round Action. Often times these are slow casting spells, such as summons, slow to execute abilities,a charge, bull-rush, or overrun. Immediate Action The rarest kind of action is an immediate action, sometimes called a reaction. These actions can be used at any point during a round by a character. A character can only use one immediate action per round. Move Actions Moving : Moving up to character's movement is considered a move action. When moving out of a threatened square, this provokes an attack of opportunity. Item Retrieval : Getting an item from a well-organized bag is a move action and provokes an attack of opportunity. Activating Motion based items : Items that require it be moved or twisted or otherwise manipulated in less than a button or command word, are move actions. This would be something like a Rod of Sealing, where the rod has to be moved in a square around the target. This provokes an attack of opportunity. Drawing a weapon : When drawing a weapon during movement is not specified, or the character is standing still, it is a move action. This provokes an attack of opportunity. Standing/Dropping : Standing up or dropping to prone is a movement action. This provokes an attack of opportunity. 5-foot step : a 5-foot step is a special move action where a character carefully moves to avoid being struck. This can sometimes be called a shift or a reposition. Drinking a Potion : Drinking a potion is a move action Standard Actions Attack(s) : Using your attack, or multiple attacks, takes the place of your standard action slot. Somethings are considered attack actions that must be used with an attack roll. This would be some spell touch attacks, trips, sunders, and disarms. Grappling : Grappling is a standard action and provokes an attack of opportunity. See Advanced Combat Actions for further details on Grappling. Casting a Spell : Most spells are standard actions and casting one provokes an attack of opportunity. Use Activated items : Items that are use-activated. This would be something like a Free Actions Speaking : Speaking is a free action, try to keep it to a 6 second blurb or simple thought in combat. Simple item retrieval : If an item is on a belt hoop, in a very easily accessed pocket, or stored for quick usage, retrieving it is a free action. Command word/thought activated items : Some magical items are activated through thoughts or command words, activating these are free actions. Swift Actions Ability/Spell Specified : The only kinds of swift actions are specified in abilities and spell entries. No swift action provokes an attack of opportunity. Immediate Action Attack of Opportunity : If at any point during your round a creature leaves one of your threatened squares, and isn't using a 5-foot step, you can make an attack of opportunity on them as an immediate action. Other actions can also allow for an attack of opportunity as specified in their entries. Without feats, a character only gets one attack of opportunity in a round. Use of a held action : A character can hold its move or standard action until a condition is met. When/If the condition is met they can act immediately with the prepared action. This will move their turn to that point in the initiative. Combat Actions Below are the rules for each combat action that can be taken, both advanced and standard. Attack : A normal attack is done by rolling 1d20 + Base Attack Bonus + Strength/Dexterity Mod + other modifiers. It is then compared to the opponents Armor Class (AC). If your attack is equal to or greater than the opponents AC it is considered a hit. Ranged Attack : A ranged attack is done by rolling 1d20 + Base Attack + Dexterity + any other modifiers. Like normal attacks it also compares against AC to determine if a hit happens. If in a threatened square this will provoke an attack of opportunity. When shooting through ally squares there is up to a 50% chance you hit your ally by accident depending on how much of the allied square the shot goes through. This is done by ear and there are no hard and fast rules on the percentages. Multiple Attacks : When a character has more than a +5 base attack bonus they gain another attack action at 5 less attack bonus, up to a maximum of four attacks. So if a character's base attack is +11 they get a second attack at +6 and a third attack at +1. This will be shown in charts as +11/+6/+1. This means when attacking the first attack in a round is the most likely to hit, and the last attack is the least. Note: Typically advanced combat maneuvers that are attack actions use the bonus from the attack order. So if a character does a disarm as their second attack. The melee touch attack uses the bonus for the character's second attack. Damage : Damage is rolled after hitting an opponent. Each weapon has it's own die type, which will be listed in the weapon entry. Then you add in strength and other modifiers after the roll. Defensive Fighting : This is an option when attacking to take a -4 circumstance penalty to attack and gain a +2 circumstance bonus to AC. Full Defensive Posture : This is a full round action in which your character does not attack, but instead focuses on defending themselves. When in Full Defensive Posture a character gains +4 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex Saves. Melee Touch Attack : This is usually a component to a spell, but it's an attack where armor does not matter since the effect need only make contact. Roll like any ranged attack but the target does not apply any Shield, Parry, Armor, or Natural armor to their AC. Dexterity, Deflection, Dodge, Insight and Luck bonuses still apply. As a special note if a spell requires a melee touch attack, the spell does not provoke an attack of opportunity even if in a threatened square. Weapon Fixation (Unarmed) and its follow up feats, apply to melee touch attacks when rolling to hit. Ranged Touch Attack : This is usually a component to a spell, but it's an attack where armor does not matter since the effect need only make contact. Roll like any ranged attack but the target does not apply any Shield, Parry, Armor, or Natural armor to their AC. Dexterity, Deflection, Dodge, Insight and Luck bonuses still apply. Casting a spell/using an ability : A spell being cast is simply called out, the DM will then check to see if you are in any threatened squares. Once done then the effect of the spell is explained by the player the monster must save against the spell. Please note some spells incorporate an attack, see attack rules above. Advance Combat Maneuvers There are things that can be done in combat that are a bit more involved than simply rolling an attack and damage. These things tend to have alternate outcomes that allow for the martially minded to control the combat arena a bit more. Much of these attacks work the same way, but will be explained as fully as they can be. Disarm : This is an attack action. To initiate a disarm, the aggressor must have as free hand or a disarming weapon. The aggressor will make a melee touch attack against the defender. This attack uses the attack bonus of the current attack, not always the highest. This provokes an attack of opportunity from the defender. If the defender is successful in dealing damage the aggressor takes a -4 penalty on the following opposed roll. The targets must then make opposed dexterity rolls. If the aggressor succeeds, the defender's weapon drops to the floor in an adjacent square. If the defender succeeds, the attempt fails. Size modifiers apply. Note: Attack of opportunity only applies if the aggressor is in the defender's threatened squares. Grapple : Grabbing another foe and holding onto them is a grapple. This is tone through a few simple steps. This is a standard action. To initiate a grapple attempt, the aggressor must make a melee touch attack. This attack uses base attack + Strength or Dexterity, whichever is higher. This provokes an attack of opportunity from the defender. If the defender is successful in dealing damage the aggressor takes a -4 penalty on the following opposed roll. Next the aggressor and defender make opposed grapple rolls. This will be the grapple modifier on your character sheet. Typically this roll is 1d20 + Highest Base Attack Bonus + Strength + Size modifier. The defender can instead substitute an escape artist for the opposed grapple roll. If the defender wins the grapple fails. If the aggressor wins the opponent is now grappled. At the beginning of every turn the defender can make another opposed grapple (or escape artist) as a free action to try to escape. The defender does not threaten any squares, and is flat footed against every opponent except the aggressor. They cannot move unless the aggressor is the one that moves them. Only weapons considered as unarmed can be used in the grapple. The defender can attack normally with unarmed attacks. The aggressor has a lot of options. Below is a small list of options that the aggressor can do. With the exception of using non-lethal unarmed attacks, all the rest require opposed grapple checks. If the defender succeeds the technique fails, but they remain grappled. Attack with non-lethal unarmed attacks : Attacking can be done normally with unarmed strikes. Break : This applies a broken bone injury to the defender. Expose : Exposing can only be done to a pinned defender. This makes them helpless to an attacker's ally allowing a kill-shot. Move : This allows the aggressor to move the defender up to half their movement speed. Submission : Holding a defender in a way that will make them faint. If successfully held for three rounds the user takes their max HP in non-lethal damage and falls unconscious. If the defender succeeds in an opposed grapple here, the submission is broken, but they are still grappled. Pin : Pinning a defender makes them unable to attack or move, but are not helpless. Shatter : This is an attack action made against their opponents weapon. Making a shatter attempt gives the aggressor a -4 circumstance penalty to AC until the beginning of their next turn. The aggressor and defender must roll opposed attacks. This attack uses the attack bonus of the current attack. If the aggressor wins the target's weapon, shield, or armor takes damage. If the defender wins the shatter attempt fails. Trip Attack : This is an attack action. To initiate a trip attempt, the aggressor must make a melee touch attack. This attack uses the attack bonus of the current attack, not always the highest. This provokes an attack of opportunity from the defender. If the defender is successful in dealing damage the aggressor takes a -4 penalty on the following opposed roll. After the attack of opportunity both parties must make opposed strength rolls. If the aggressor succeeds, the defender is knocked prone. If the defender succeeds, the trip attempt fails. Size modifiers apply. Note: Attack of opportunity only applies if the aggressor is in the defender's threatened squares.","title":"Combat Rules"},{"location":"combat%20rules/#combat","text":"Combat is when physical altercations need to be resolved.

Attack : A normal attack is done by rolling 1d20 + Base Attack Bonus + Strength/Dexterity Mod + other modifiers. It is then compared to the opponents Armor Class (AC). If your attack is equal to or greater than the opponents AC it is considered a hit. Ranged Attack : A ranged attack is done by rolling 1d20 + Base Attack + Dexterity + any other modifiers. Like normal attacks it also compares against AC to determine if a hit happens. If in a threatened square this will provoke an attack of opportunity. When shooting through ally squares there is up to a 50% chance you hit your ally by accident depending on how much of the allied square the shot goes through. This is done by ear and there are no hard and fast rules on the percentages. Multiple Attacks : When a character has more than a +5 base attack bonus they gain another attack action at 5 less attack bonus, up to a maximum of four attacks. So if a character's base attack is +11 they get a second attack at +6 and a third attack at +1. This will be shown in charts as +11/+6/+1. This means when attacking the first attack in a round is the most likely to hit, and the last attack is the least. Note: Typically advanced combat maneuvers that are attack actions use the bonus from the attack order. So if a character does a disarm as their second attack. The melee touch attack uses the bonus for the character's second attack. Damage : Damage is rolled after hitting an opponent. Each weapon has it's own die type, which will be listed in the weapon entry. Then you add in strength and other modifiers after the roll. Defensive Fighting : This is an option when attacking to take a -4 circumstance penalty to attack and gain a +2 circumstance bonus to AC. Full Defensive Posture : This is a full round action in which your character does not attack, but instead focuses on defending themselves. When in Full Defensive Posture a character gains +4 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex Saves. Melee Touch Attack : This is usually a component to a spell, but it's an attack where armor does not matter since the effect need only make contact. Roll like any ranged attack but the target does not apply any Shield, Parry, Armor, or Natural armor to their AC. Dexterity, Deflection, Dodge, Insight and Luck bonuses still apply. As a special note if a spell requires a melee touch attack, the spell does not provoke an attack of opportunity even if in a threatened square. Weapon Fixation (Unarmed) and its follow up feats, apply to melee touch attacks when rolling to hit. Ranged Touch Attack : This is usually a component to a spell, but it's an attack where armor does not matter since the effect need only make contact. Roll like any ranged attack but the target does not apply any Shield, Parry, Armor, or Natural armor to their AC. Dexterity, Deflection, Dodge, Insight and Luck bonuses still apply. Casting a spell/using an ability : A spell being cast is simply called out, the DM will then check to see if you are in any threatened squares. Once done then the effect of the spell is explained by the player the monster must save against the spell.

To initiate a disarm, the aggressor must have as free hand or a disarming weapon. The aggressor will make a melee touch attack against the defender.

Roll 5d4 and reroll any 1's. Do this 5 times and select your preferred stat and apply an automatic 18 to it. Attack Curve : There are three kinds of attack curves that one can choose from; low, middle, and high. These affect your base HD type, skill growth, and Saves. After selecting your attack curve then apply the Magic Growth modifiers, listed in the chart, to your HD and skills. Magic Growth : A character may or may not be magically inclined. Select the amount of magical ability that is best for your concept and apply an attack curve to your choice to get the foundation for your character. Perk : These are bonus abilities or feats gained at designated levels. Feat : Feats modify already present abilities, actions, skills, and so on. These are earned at first level, and every HD divisible cleanly by 3 thereafter. Bonus Feat : These are feats on top of the feats your character gets from leveling normally. The character must still meet any prerequisites for the feat chosen. Ability : Thematic tricks, features, and other nifty things your character can do. Abilities are often regular use abilities that may or may not be useful in combat. They may include Spell-like abilities, sneak-attack, and other thematic things. Definitions : These are character-defining options that a character must choose. The first-level definitions are much more impactful than later ones. Undefined is always an option and will have bonuses of their own. Spells Known : In this system spells known refers to the number of spells magic users can choose to cast spontaneously. Once chosen these can only be swapped out at level-up or GM defined areas/times. Spells Per Day : What it says on the tin. Primary Mental Attribute : When creating the character choose a Mental Attribute, Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma. This will then become the Primary. Abilities, feats, and s that derive from your Mental Attribute will draw from your choice. Spellcasting DCs, spell casting capability, and bonus spells will also be determined by this choice. Trained Skills : This is the number of skills your character can have as, \"Trained Skills.\" This number is equal to 4 + Total Base Skill Growth + Level 1 Int Mod. If your base intelligence modifier, without any magical modifiers, increases; you gain another trained skill. Other skills can be taken with story justification or by downtime in which they can justify the skill becoming trained. Bonus HP : Bonus is HP gained on top of Hit Dice and Constitution modifiers. Spell Proficiency : Spell proficiency is added to Spells, Spell-like abilities(Sp), Supernatural Abilities(Su) DC's; and any non-touch attack roll. It is also applied as a flat bonus for each damage/healing/warding dice for Spells, Spell-like abilities(Sp), or Supernatural Abilities(Su). For example, if a character has a spell that deals 5d6 damage and has a Casting Proficiency of 2 it will be 5d6+10 damage.

There is Non-Magical, Basic Magic, Standard Magic, and Advanced Magic. Choose which would best suite what you have in mind for your character. In these charts you will see three sub-options of, Combat Focus, Generalist, and Specialist. You will want to pick these based on how focused or thematic you want your character. A combat-focused character has a lot of feat options, and this will give them a great deal of passive bonuses that make them more straight forward to use. For example, with Combat Focus it is possible to get enough feats to be a powerful weapon master that rarely misses with their weapon of choice and will have a lot of bonuses to advance combat maneuvers like grappling. A specialist character will have access to lots of abilities which will give them a lot of thematic tools to use as they see fit. For example a specialist can have a breath weapon to use, access to extra dimensional storage, and project an aura that makes their enemies less effective in battle.

Roll 5d4 and reroll any 1's. Do this 5 times and select your preferred stat and apply an automatic 18 to it. Attack Curve : There are three kinds of attack curves that one can choose from; low, middle, and high. These affect your base HD type, skill growth, and Saves. After selecting your attack curve then apply the Magic Growth modifiers, listed in the chart, to your HD and skills. Magic Growth : A character may or may not be magically inclined. Select the amount of magical ability that is best for your concept and apply an attack curve to your choice to get the foundation for your character. Perk : These are bonus abilities or feats gained at designated levels. Feat : Feats modify already present abilities, actions, skills, and so on. These are earned at first level, and every HD divisible cleanly by 3 thereafter. Bonus Feat : These are feats on top of the feats your character gets from leveling normally. The character must still meet any prerequisites for the feat chosen. Ability : Thematic tricks, features, and other nifty things your character can do. Abilities are often regular use abilities that may or may not be useful in combat. They may include Spell-like abilities, sneak-attack, and other thematic things. Definitions : These are character-defining options that a character must choose. The first-level definitions are much more impactful than later ones. Undefined is always an option and will have bonuses of their own. Spells Known : In this system spells known refers to the number of spells magic users can choose to cast spontaneously. Once chosen these can only be swapped out at level-up or GM defined areas/times. Spells Per Day : What it says on the tin. Primary Mental Attribute : When creating the character choose a Mental Attribute, Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma. This will then become the Primary. Abilities, feats, and s that derive from your Mental Attribute will draw from your choice. Spellcasting DCs, spell casting capability, and bonus spells will also be determined by this choice. Trained Skills : This is the number of skills your character can have as, \"Trained Skills.\" This number is equal to 4 + Total Base Skill Growth + Level 1 Int Mod. If your base intelligence modifier, without any magical modifiers, increases; you gain another trained skill. Other skills can be taken with story justification or by downtime in which they can justify the skill becoming trained. Bonus HP : Bonus is HP gained on top of Hit Dice and Constitution modifiers. Spell Proficiency : Spell proficiency is added to Spells, Spell-like abilities(Sp), Supernatural Abilities(Su) DC's; and any non-touch attack roll. It is also applied as a flat bonus for each damage/healing/warding dice for Spells, Spell-like abilities(Sp), or Supernatural Abilities(Su). For example, if a character has a spell that deals 5d6 damage and has a Casting Proficiency of 2 it will be 5d6+10 damage.","title":"The Basics"},{"location":"progression/#universal-progression","text":"All characters will obtain skill points, feats, attribute score increases, and definitions as they level.

With that in mind there are several dozen ways to go about it. It can be purely cosmetic where there are no differences in race/species, it could be mild balanced statistical redistribution, or there could be level adjustments applied and imbalanced statistical distribution applied. With that said it boils down to what the game master would think is most applicable to the world they are building. Whether they go with an entirely constructionist view--where all race/species are balanced, complete essentialist--where the differences are sharp and clearly measurable, or go somewhere in the middle. It is important that the game master be consistent in the choice here though. The examples below will be separated into Mixed, or Essentialist categories. Constructionist will be explained as a rule that applies to all race/species. Terms Hit Dice - Another name for level. Level Gap Increase - This is a rule that applies when a race/species has imbalanced stats/abilities. It will increase the experience required by the equivalent level total. For example \u2014 It normally takes 1,000 experience to go from level 1 to level 2. If a race/species has a gap of +1 it will add the required experience to go from level 2 to level 3 to the gap between level 1 and level 2. So in total it would take 3,000 experience to go from level 1 to level 2 instead of 1,000. Effective Hit Dice - This is the level gap + the character\u2019s Hit Die. This is what is used to determine challenge, experience, rewards, and so on. Always use the effective hit dice of the character. Constructionist - This rule set will only apply the most extreme race/specie differences. Such as size category, number of limbs, and other plainly obvious things. Otherwise anything under this system gets +4 skill points at first level and +1 skill point every level thereafter, and a bonus feat. Mixed - This is a rule set where the physical aspects of the race is inherent, but there are no natural inclinations for behavior, skills, feats, or abilities. There will be attribute balances and uneven ones. Level Gaps do exist in this category but, tend to be low. Essentialist - This rule set is where there are sharp and obvious strength and power differences between races/species. Here you will see strongly suggested alignments. Skill Bonuses, abilities, and often more extreme imbalances in attributes. Often time Level Gaps are higher here than their Mixed example counterparts. Size - the size category of the creature. Small sized are weaker and will off set imbalanced attribute distributions. Large size creatures would inherently gain a level gap due to the benefits of being large. See Size Categories for what this effects. Examples Goblin A short species with a reputation for being unorganized, dirty, and violent. Their skin tones range from dark brown, orange, grey, or green. While the reputation can be unfounded among some tribes, it isn\u2019t among others. Goblins have broad pointy ears, they are a cousin species to elves, though notably shorter. Highly tribal, they divide themselves among clans. Their societal structure tends to be based on who is the strongest/most violent and can hold power over the weaker members of the tribe. Others are more political and organized with a clear system of power, class, and all the whistles and bells of a functioning society. It is no mystery which of these two types live among other sapient species and which doesn\u2019t. Small Sized Heights range from 3\u2019 to 3'8\" examples beyond either threshold are very rare Weight varies a bit more depending on body build. This can range from 30-80 lbs Mixed Attribute Modifications: -2 Strength, +2 Dex, and +2 Intelligence. Goblin Guile : Pick two skills and add a +2 species bonus to them, these will increase for every 3 HD. Essentialist Level Gap: +1 Attribute Modifications: -2 Strength, +2 Dex, and +4 Intelligence. Gain Mechanist Familiar as an ability. +2 to Search, +2 to Disable Device, these will increase by +1 every for every 3 hit dice. Alignment: Neutral Any, they have a semi-lax view on law. Morality is determined by tribe. Human A ubiquitous species known for their charisma and leadership skills. Strong warriors within the species aren\u2019t unheard of, they tend to focus more on strategy, politics, and fame rather than being a warrior species. Like Leonal, due to their shorter lifespan they breed more often. This is why they have large numbers and are so common compared to longer lived species, such as elves and dwarves. Medium size Heights are sexually dimorphic Females range from 4\u201911\u2019\u2019 to 5\u201910\u2019\u2019\u2019 examples beyond either threshold are very rare Males range from 5\u20192\u2019\u2019 to 6\u20198\u2019\u2019 examples beyond either threshold are very rare.

There are also generalist spells which is a list borrowed from all three varieties. Arcane : Drawing from general magical energy arcane spells tend to be flashy and are derived either from a person's knowledge or a person's gumption. Some see it as a science, others an art. Either way, arcane spells tend to be associated with city-folk and their methods of magic. Divine : A deity will use a person as a conduit for their bidding, those favored in this manner have access to divine magic; a gift from their god. This does not mean they need to worship a specific god, a sufficiently fervent person can have multiple deities channeling through them, though the person might not realize who's tool they are. Nature : Those in touch with nature know its ways and its methods and how to use it to an end. Such casters tend to work with the natural world with an empathic understanding of their environment, they are able to shake rocks, control plants, or even become animals themselves. All of these spells derive their effectiveness from a primary mental attribute, or PMA. This will determine the amount of spells per day, or spell slots, the character has. A minimum PMA of 10 + Spell level is needed to cast levels of that level. For example a 5th level spell would need a 15 PMA. PMA : Primary Mental Attribute. These are chosen at character creation and are selected from Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. Once selected it cannot be changed. Certain definitions and abilities have specific PMA requirements. PMA mod : This is the modifier from your primary mental attribute Components [M]: Spell components come in a lot of varieties and are consumed on the use of the spell. Most are very inexpensive and can be assumed purchased when, 'refilling your spell component pouch.' Any component that costs 1 GP or more must be specifically purchased and held within your inventory. Focus [F]: A focus is an object, sometimes required by spells, that helps the caster user their spells. If a focus has 10x the value of a material component, the spell can be cast without the material component. Focuses tend to be staves, orbs, wands, holy symbol, crystals, or anything that is thematic to the caster. Somatic [S]: Most spells have somatic components, which require hand, body, or other kinds of motions. If restricted spells that require somatic components cannot be cast. Verbal [V]: Most spells have verbal components. These are incantations, holy recitations, or other thematic vocalizations. If silenced in anyway spells that requite verbal components cannot be cast. Damage/Healing : A lot of spells deal damage and any spell that has a damage or healing roll involved also ads the PMA modifier at the end. Casting a Spell : Casting a spell is relatively simple your character takes the appropriate actions; immediate, swift, standard, or full-round action and the target of their spell makes a save. It is also possible an attack roll is made for a spell, if so, follow the kind of attack required. Please note a full-round spell finishes at the beginning of the cater's next turn. Spell Resistance : Spell resistance (SR) works like armor class, though it isn\u2019t as easy to obtain. If a spell is subject to spell resistance, and the target has any. Simply roll 1d20 + Caster Level + any other mods you might have to it. Concentration : Concentration refers to a few different things in spell casting. In general, it\u2019s based on the skill Concentration, which is the ability to hold a spell or cast a spell while adverse things are happening. For example: When you cast a spell it provokes an attack of opportunity from anyone who\u2019s threatened squares the caster is in. If hit from that attack a concentration check will need to be made to see if you can cast the spell. Below are circumstances, and their DC, where concentration checks apply. Damaged while casting: DC = Damage Dealt Grappled: DC = 10; opposed grapple needed to even cast Distracted: DC = 15 Casting Defensively: DC = 10 + Spell Level Concentrating/Rage: These have their own rules see their entries. Concentrating : Some spells have a duration labeled as, \"Concentration,\" or \u201cConcentration Max X rounds.\u201d This means you must focus on that spell and cannot cast any other spell or effect that has the duration described as \"Concentration.\" Other standard actions can be taken. If you are struck, grappled, or otherwise distracted while maintaining a concentration spell, you must roll a concentration check. Metamagic : Metamagic is the magic of altering magic. All spell casters can apply the concept to their spells. They can prepare a lower-level spell into a higher-level spell slot and treat that spell as if it were in the higher-level slot for purposes of calculating the spell's DC. There are also feats that create modifications of this. Simplex Spells All casters get spells they can cast at their whim. These are spells so simple they take little to no energy to use. In essence, they only do one thing and do not do very much damage or healing overall. Most effects are limited, so when creating these bear this in mind. Simplex spells are divided into Arcane, Divine, Generalist, and Natural and are selectable in accordance with the kind of magic a character can cast. At level up these can always be changed, feats can also be selected to gain further Simplex spells. In general Basic casters have 2, Standard casters have 3, and Advanced casters have 4. Be sure to read notes, as some take a long time to cast despite being simple. All DCs for these spells are 10 + Primary Mental Attribute See full spell list for full spell information, below are summaries Advance Simplex Spells Some definitions allow the use of advanced simplex spells which are more powerful than their standard counterparts.

Below is a list of all the terms and what they mean. Spell Slot - This is a use of a spell for that given level. If you have 3 spells per day for first-level spells, you have 3 first-level spell slots. Prepared Spell - The most common kind of spell, this is a spell that has to be prayed for, meditated for, or memorized at the beginning of the day. The number of prepared spells is limited by your Spell Slots. Known Spell - This is a spell you do not need to prepare, and can instead sacrifice an already prepared spell slot to cast this spell instead. Damage Reduction(DR) - This is a mitigation that resists all physical types of damage. Physical damage comes in the form of Bludgeoning, crushing, piercing, and slashing damage. Damage reduction will be formatted as Reduction Value / What bypasses it. For example, 5/piercing would reduce all incoming physical damage by 5, except piercing. A damage reduction of 5/- would reduce all incoming physical damage. There are some rarer types of damage reduction like #/Adamantine or #/magic. These would be DR that only adamantine can bypass or only a magical weapon can bypass. Energy Resistance(ER) - This is a mitigation that protects against energy damage typically done through magic. These types consist of Fire(heat), Acid, Ice(cold), Sonic, Force, electricity, negative, and positive. The format for this kind of resistance will be the name of the energy type and the mitigation value behind it. For example, Fire 10 will reduce all incoming heat and fire damage by 10. There are a handful of Fire(Heat) - This is high thermal energy-based damage, they are synonymous with each other as far as resistances are concerned. The only reason that one might be used in place of the other is for theming purposes. A concentrated light ray will burn you without the use of fire, for example. So it would be labeled as heat damage. Ice(Cold) - This is low thermal energy-based damage, they are synonymous with each other as far as resistances are concerned. Typically Ice damage will be paired with a physical damage type","title":"Terminology"},{"location":"weapons/","text":"Weapons Everyone's favorite aspect of any system are the tools we can used to fell foes and break things.

Please refer to the list below for how they work and what they are. General Terminology Weapon Group : These are groups of weapons specified within the above chart for the purposes of feat categories. Examples of this are proficiency feats, focus feats, and specialization feats. As with all things in this set up, this is just a suggested grouping set, though more can be created by working with the game master as needed. Damage : This shows what kind of die to roll for damage rolls. Damage Type : This is the type of damage the weapon deals. Some creatures are resistant to some types of damage. P : Piercing weapon, deals piercing damage. S : Slashing weapon, deals slashing damage. B : Blunt weapon, deals bludgeoning damage. Critical : This shows the critical range and multiplier of a weapon. One Handed Weapon : This is a weapon that can be used in one hand, allowing for the free hand to cast spells or use a shield. Two Handed Weapon : Any weapon that is typically wielded in two hands is a two-handed weapon. Weapons like this typically cannot have a shield equipped at the same time, unless otherwise specified. Spells cannot be cast while wielding a two handed weapon. These kinds of weapons gain a 50% bonus from their strength in damage. For example if your character has a +4 to strength. The bonus to damage will be +6 instead. This bonus only applies if a shield is not being used with a two handed weapon. Reach Weapon : This is a term for a weapon that can attack a set of tiles one step further than adjacent squares. Attacks made at the full distance are at a full attack bonus, while attacks and damage rolls made to enemies in adjacent squares are at a -2 penalty. Thrown Weapon : Thrown weapons are weapons that are thrown at a range. These are counted as ranged attacks for mechanics though they apply 1/2 strength modifier instead of none. Ranged Only : These are weapons that cannot make melee attacks. Masterwork : Masterwork weapons gain a +1 bonus to attack, and an extra 2 base hardness and 5 hp. Masterwork weapons cost 60 gp more than the base cost of the weapon. For weapons that do not have a cost, the masterwork cost will be 60 gp. Composite Bows : Composite bows are crafted as masterwork and require a higher strength to draw, but in turn allow strength mod to be applied to damage. Minimum strength required to pull a composite bow is 14 Technical Weapons Disarming Weapon : These are weapons that are able to make disarm attacks, rather than having to use your hands. For reach weapons this can be done in adjacent or the reach squares. They gain a +2 circumstance bonus when defending from or attempting disarm attacks. Tripping Weapon : These are weapons that are able to make trip attacks, rather than having to use your hands. For reach weapons this can be done in adjacent or reach squares. They gain a +2 circumstance bonus when defending from or initiating trip attacks. Grapple Weapon : This is a weapon that can be used in place of unarmed attacks while in a grapple. Alternate Attack Options Half-Sword : This is a term for gripping the sword by the blade with a leading hand to increase point control. As a free action specify that your character will be half-swording for the round. Gain +2 to all attack rolls in the round and a -4 to all damage. Quillon Strike : This is a term for holding a long sword by the blade and striking with the quillons. All damage becomes bludgeoning and piercing for this attack. It is a move action to re-adjust grip and another move action to change your grip back. While using this form take a -2 penalty to all attacks and outright ignore 2 points of any damage reduction type. Weapon Hardness/HP : Since there are too many weapons here to give individual values the values are recorded in the chart below. Type Hardness HP Light Bladed Weapons 5 5 Long Bladed Weapons 5 10 Wood shafted weapons 2 10 Bows/Crossbows 2 5 Weapon Descriptions Dagger : A simple spike of metal attached to a handle. They are primarily for stabbing and getting into the visor of armor users. Complicated grappling techniques are associated with daggers such as rondel daggers, baselards, and bollock daggers. Any weapon that fits this bill, such as a stiletto, can use the dagger's stats. Long Knife : Sometimes called shortswords these are too short to be an arming sword, but focused on cut and thrust more so than a dagger. These are versatile blades than can be used for a number of applications, quite popular with travelers. Kukri : Popular slashing knives, used to clear brush and reeds with ease, they have a sharp inward curve, sort of like a sickle, and a heavy front. They serve somewhere between a hatchet and a machete. Any front heavy slashing focused blade would use the stats of a kukri. Katar : Sometimes called a punching dagger, the handle is perpendicular to the blade with metal langets on either side to protect the user's arm. If activated these can split into three points and be used to disarm. Arming Sword : The typical blade for self professed heroes, especially in fairy tales. This is a fairly long sword that is wielded with one hand, typically paired with a shield. Much more typically this blade is used by archers as a backup weapon. Any relatively long blade, too long to be a longknife but too short to be used well in two hands would be an arming sword. Khopesh/Sickle : Both of these weapons are different but would have the same effective. A reduced cutting contact surface be it inward curve like a sickle or an outward curve like a khopesh. Both have a hooked shape that is useful for tripping. Longsword : Sometimes called a hand-and-a-half or bastard sword. This is a weapon that describes blades that it is possible to swing one handed but is best used two handed. Bola : Two heave weights tied to a string. These are spun over head and thrown at a targets feet. This weapon simultaneously does damage and a trip attack. Weapon Groups Weapon groups are groups of weapons that fall along the line of training types, roles, and themes. Below will be some examples of weapon groupings, and by no means are all there is. These can be created as needed. Typically they consist of 3-5 Weapons and are named according to the idea of who would use them. When creating them keep the concept of the group's user in mind. Work with your GM on the matter and see if they have input. Most feats that enhance weapons will enhance groups at the more general level. Archer : Short bow, Longbow, Arming Sword and Dagger Ranger : Short Bow, Longsword, Tomahawk, and War Axe Berserker : Greatsword, Battle Axe, Hurlbat, and Battle Mace Druid : Sickle, Long Knife, Short bow, Atlatl and Sling. Infantry : Spear, Bill, Arming Sword, War Hammer, and Heavy Mace. Militiaman : Stave, Longknife, Kreigmesser, Shortbow, and War Scythe. Guard : Light Mace, Longbow, Halberd, and Ranseur Mage : Arming Sword, Long Knife, Heavy Macy, Sickle, and Handaxe Scout : Sling, Short bow, Longbow, Throwing Dagger, and Long Knife Swordsman : Long Knife, Kreigmesser, Longsword, Greatsword and Tuck Wanderer : Kukri, Long Knife, Stave, and Short bow Kobold Essentials : Short Bow, Spear, Dagger, Long Knife, War Pick Kobold Warrior : Atlatl, Ranseur, Arming Sword, War Axe, War Hammer Hunter : Spear, Atlatl, Longsword, Longknife, Huntsman Axe Wanderlust : Longbow, Unarmed, Stave, Dagger and Hurlbat Salt Outrider : Bolas, Spear, Shortbow, pole hammer, long knife Weapon Proficiency When creating your character, the progression chart you choose determines how many weapons your character is proficient with. When you are proficient with a weapon all features function as you would expect. If your character is not proficient with a weapon they receive a -2 penalty in the use of the weapon, cannot make full round attacks with the weapon, cannot use any of the secondary features of a weapon -- such as half-sword -- and they cannot fight defensively in any capacity with the weapon. Typically to gain proficiency a character needs the, \"Weapons Training (Weapon Group,)\" feat. Which is obtained whenever a feat or bonus feat is gained. Some progressions offer individual weapon proficiency or an entire group.","title":"Weapons"},{"location":"weapons/#weapons","text":"Everyone's favorite aspect of any system are the tools we can used to fell foes and break things.

Please refer to the list below for how they work and what they are.","title":"Weapon Terms"},{"location":"weapons/#general-terminology","text":"Weapon Group : These are groups of weapons specified within the above chart for the purposes of feat categories. Examples of this are proficiency feats, focus feats, and specialization feats. As with all things in this set up, this is just a suggested grouping set, though more can be created by working with the game master as needed. Damage : This shows what kind of die to roll for damage rolls. Damage Type : This is the type of damage the weapon deals. Some creatures are resistant to some types of damage. P : Piercing weapon, deals piercing damage. S : Slashing weapon, deals slashing damage. B : Blunt weapon, deals bludgeoning damage. Critical : This shows the critical range and multiplier of a weapon. One Handed Weapon : This is a weapon that can be used in one hand, allowing for the free hand to cast spells or use a shield. Two Handed Weapon : Any weapon that is typically wielded in two hands is a two-handed weapon. Weapons like this typically cannot have a shield equipped at the same time, unless otherwise specified. Spells cannot be cast while wielding a two handed weapon. These kinds of weapons gain a 50% bonus from their strength in damage. For example if your character has a +4 to strength. The bonus to damage will be +6 instead. This bonus only applies if a shield is not being used with a two handed weapon. Reach Weapon : This is a term for a weapon that can attack a set of tiles one step further than adjacent squares. Attacks made at the full distance are at a full attack bonus, while attacks and damage rolls made to enemies in adjacent squares are at a -2 penalty. Thrown Weapon : Thrown weapons are weapons that are thrown at a range. These are counted as ranged attacks for mechanics though they apply 1/2 strength modifier instead of none. Ranged Only : These are weapons that cannot make melee attacks. Masterwork : Masterwork weapons gain a +1 bonus to attack, and an extra 2 base hardness and 5 hp. Masterwork weapons cost 60 gp more than the base cost of the weapon. For weapons that do not have a cost, the masterwork cost will be 60 gp. Composite Bows : Composite bows are crafted as masterwork and require a higher strength to draw, but in turn allow strength mod to be applied to damage. Minimum strength required to pull a composite bow is 14","title":"General Terminology"},{"location":"weapons/#technical-weapons","text":"Disarming Weapon : These are weapons that are able to make disarm attacks, rather than having to use your hands. For reach weapons this can be done in adjacent or the reach squares. They gain a +2 circumstance bonus when defending from or attempting disarm attacks. Tripping Weapon : These are weapons that are able to make trip attacks, rather than having to use your hands. For reach weapons this can be done in adjacent or reach squares. They gain a +2 circumstance bonus when defending from or initiating trip attacks. Grapple Weapon : This is a weapon that can be used in place of unarmed attacks while in a grapple.","title":"Technical Weapons"},{"location":"weapons/#alternate-attack-options","text":"Half-Sword : This is a term for gripping the sword by the blade with a leading hand to increase point control. As a free action specify that your character will be half-swording for the round. Gain +2 to all attack rolls in the round and a -4 to all damage. Quillon Strike : This is a term for holding a long sword by the blade and striking with the quillons. All damage becomes bludgeoning and piercing for this attack. It is a move action to re-adjust grip and another move action to change your grip back. While using this form take a -2 penalty to all attacks and outright ignore 2 points of any damage reduction type. Weapon Hardness/HP : Since there are too many weapons here to give individual values the values are recorded in the chart below. Type Hardness HP Light Bladed Weapons 5 5 Long Bladed Weapons 5 10 Wood shafted weapons 2 10 Bows/Crossbows 2 5","title":"Alternate Attack Options"},{"location":"weapons/#weapon-descriptions","text":"Dagger : A simple spike of metal attached to a handle. They are primarily for stabbing and getting into the visor of armor users. Complicated grappling techniques are associated with daggers such as rondel daggers, baselards, and bollock daggers. Any weapon that fits this bill, such as a stiletto, can use the dagger's stats. Long Knife : Sometimes called shortswords these are too short to be an arming sword, but focused on cut and thrust more so than a dagger. These are versatile blades than can be used for a number of applications, quite popular with travelers. Kukri : Popular slashing knives, used to clear brush and reeds with ease, they have a sharp inward curve, sort of like a sickle, and a heavy front. They serve somewhere between a hatchet and a machete. Any front heavy slashing focused blade would use the stats of a kukri. Katar : Sometimes called a punching dagger, the handle is perpendicular to the blade with metal langets on either side to protect the user's arm. If activated these can split into three points and be used to disarm. Arming Sword : The typical blade for self professed heroes, especially in fairy tales. This is a fairly long sword that is wielded with one hand, typically paired with a shield. Much more typically this blade is used by archers as a backup weapon. Any relatively long blade, too long to be a longknife but too short to be used well in two hands would be an arming sword. Khopesh/Sickle : Both of these weapons are different but would have the same effective. A reduced cutting contact surface be it inward curve like a sickle or an outward curve like a khopesh. Both have a hooked shape that is useful for tripping. Longsword : Sometimes called a hand-and-a-half or bastard sword. This is a weapon that describes blades that it is possible to swing one handed but is best used two handed. Bola : Two heave weights tied to a string. These are spun over head and thrown at a targets feet. This weapon simultaneously does damage and a trip attack.","title":"Weapon Descriptions"},{"location":"weapons/#weapon-groups","text":"Weapon groups are groups of weapons that fall along the line of training types, roles, and themes. Below will be some examples of weapon groupings, and by no means are all there is. These can be created as needed. Typically they consist of 3-5 Weapons and are named according to the idea of who would use them. When creating them keep the concept of the group's user in mind. Work with your GM on the matter and see if they have input. Most feats that enhance weapons will enhance groups at the more general level. Archer : Short bow, Longbow, Arming Sword and Dagger Ranger : Short Bow, Longsword, Tomahawk, and War Axe Berserker : Greatsword, Battle Axe, Hurlbat, and Battle Mace Druid : Sickle, Long Knife, Short bow, Atlatl and Sling.

When you are proficient with a weapon all features function as you would expect. If your character is not proficient with a weapon they receive a -2 penalty in the use of the weapon, cannot make full round attacks with the weapon, cannot use any of the secondary features of a weapon -- such as half-sword -- and they cannot fight defensively in any capacity with the weapon. Typically to gain proficiency a character needs the, \"Weapons Training (Weapon Group,)\" feat. Which is obtained whenever a feat or bonus feat is gained.

Depending on what your character is trying to do there are different DCs and modifiers to your roll. Jumping If your character needs to jump they typically require at least a 10 foot running start for a medium or small sized creature. Large size creatures require 10 ft more for every category beyond medium. Smaller creatures only need 5 ft, which is the minimum. Long jumps are easier than high jumps, for rolls and DCs please review the chart below. For high jumps the value will be for what is vaulted over, not how high they are able to reach with their hands. To get the reach take the high jump height and add 3 ft. There are times when a creatures movement speed is faster than 30 ft. For ever 10 feet of speed above 30 a creature gains a +2 movement bonus to their jump rolls.
