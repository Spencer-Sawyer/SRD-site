    <h1 id="improved-telekinetics-su">Improved Telekinetics (Su)</h1>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Primary mental attribute 16, must be capable of casting magic, Lesser Telekinetics<br />
<strong>Use</strong>: 1 + 1 per PMA per day <br />
<strong>Action</strong>: Standard <br />
<strong>Target</strong>: Object or Person targeted<br />
<strong>Range</strong>: Short (25 ft + 5 ft per 2 HD)  <br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: Instant or 1 minute per HD; see text <br />
<strong>Saving Throw</strong>: None; see text <br />
<strong>Spell Resistance</strong>: Yes</p>
<p>With this ability one can move objects around and carry them without touching them.  Their primary mental attribute determines carry, lift, and push weights as if it were strength for the purposes of use. A hurled object with improved does 1d6 damage for every 10 lbs it weighs with an effective range of 40 feet from its initial position. An object can be thrown only if it is at the maximum light load weight or less. This is treated as a ranged attack but the character's caster level is the attack bonus and is modified by their mental attributes. If the object is over 25 lbs this is treated as a touch attack. Maximum movable object by weight is 10 lbs / HD</p>
<p>Sustained pushing at the max limit will fatigue a character after 2 rounds and exhaust a character after 5 rounds. When pushing or pulling things in medium load's weight a character will be fatigued after 10 rounds and exhausted after 25. Pushing or pulling an object within the character's light load will not fatigue them. Pushing, pulling, and carrying objects is not an instant action and uses the duration instead.</p>
<p>If the target of your telekinesis is living, the only actions that can be attempted is are Bull Rush and Overrun. Treat the character's caster level as their base attack and their mental attribute modifier as their strength. This is considered to be a bull rush attempt from a medium sized creature. Unlike the standard uses of these, they provoke no attacks of opportunity unless they are within melee range, and they cannot simply be avoided.</p>
<p>Disarm attempts can be made with improved telekinesis. For purposes of calculation the character's caster level is the Base Attack, and the primary mental attribute modifies it. Improved telekinesis is considered to be a single handed standard weapon. If successful the weapon can be dropped, or thrown using the formula above for damage added to the weapon damage.</p>
