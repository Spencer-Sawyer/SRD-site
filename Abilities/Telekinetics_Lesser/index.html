    <h1 id="lesser-telekinetics-su">Lesser Telekinetics (Su)</h1>
<p><strong>Prerequisite</strong>: Primary mental attribute 14, must be capable of casting magic <br />
<strong>Use</strong>: 1 + 1 per PMA per day <br />
<strong>Action</strong>: Standard <br />
<strong>Target</strong>: Object or Person targeted <br />
<strong>Range</strong>: Short (25 ft + 5 ft per 2 HD) <br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: Instant or 1 minute per HD; see text <br />
<strong>Saving Throw</strong>: None; see text <br />
<strong>Spell Resistance</strong>: Yes</p>
<p>With this ability one can move objects around and carry them without touching them.  Their primary mental attribute determines carry, lift, and push weights as if it were strength for the purposes of use. A hurled object with lesser does 1d4 damage for every 10 lbs it weighs (Max 20d4) with an effective range of 20 feet from its initial position. An object can be thrown only if it is at the characterâ€™s maximum light load weight or less. This is treated as a ranged attack but the character's caster level is the attack bonus and is modified by their mental attribute. If the object is over 25 lbs this is treated as a touch attack. Maximum movable object by weight is 5 lbs / HD</p>
<p>Sustained pushing at the max limit will fatigue a character after 2 rounds and exhaust a character after 5 rounds. When pushing or pulling things in medium load's weight a character will be fatigued after 10 rounds and exhausted after 25. Pushing, pulling, and carrying objects is not an instant action and uses the duration instead.</p>
<p>If the target of your telekinesis is living, the only actions that can be attempted is are Bull Rush and Overrun. Treat the character's caster level as their base attack and their mental attribute modifier as their strength. This is considered to be a bull rush attempt from a small sized creature. Unlike the standard uses of these, they provoke no attack of opportunity unless they are within melee range, and they cannot simply be avoided.</p>
