<h1 id="afflictions">Afflictions</h1>
<p>Afflictions are things that make life harder for your character in some ways. They introduce flavor and intrigue into how a character is. These can be taken at any time willingly by a player unless specified in the description. Afflictions can also be bestowed on a character either through massive damage, curses, or other means through the course of a campaign. Most of these effects are permanent unless removed with a break-enchantment spell, in the case of magically induced ones; or a Cure Affliction spell/effect. Temporary effects often turn into a permanent effect.</p>
<h2 id="types">Types</h2>
<p>There are several types of afflictions and their chances which can be cured, how, or if they can even be cured at all. All afflictions can be applied from a spell, in which case their type because Curse. Refer to the list below for more information</p>
<p><strong>Curse</strong> - These are bestowed with the "Bestow Curse" Spell any non-wound affliction can be applied to a target with this spell. No matter which is applied, the curse curing methods can be used. A good example of a famous curse would be Lycanthropy.</p>
<p><strong>Disease</strong> - Any affliction caused by pathogens, magical or otherwise, fall into this category. This does not include diseases that stem from a person's own body. When a disease is given, pick the approriate disease based afflictions and apply them all. A good example of a disease would be Influenza (which would fall under Sickly - Respiratory)</p>
<p><strong>Genetic</strong> - These are taken at character creation, and cannot be cured with anything less than a wish spell. A Genetic affliction is part of the character's design. These typically would take the form of auto-immune disease, genetic disorders, and other things that the body does poorly. When a Genetic affliction is chosen, pick the approriate afflictions and apply them all. A good example would be Sarcoidosis (All three “Sickly” afflictions and Bad Joints).</p>
<p><strong>Injury</strong> - When a wound becomes permanent it is an injury. Some things bypass the wound category and go straight into injury. Injuries require time to recover but can be healed with non-magical means. A good example is a broken leg that was set wrong. Heal Skill DCs are specific to the injury, some require surgery.</p>
<p><strong>Wound</strong> - After a critical hit there is a 20% chance to get a wound. A wound is a temporary affliction that has a 50% chance to become an Injury if not healed. All wound heal DCs are equal to 10 + affected character's HD - Con Mod. This also required the use of a Wound-Binding Kit. A good example of a wound would be an arrow through the knee.</p>
