<h1 id="the-basics"><div style=text-align:center>The Basics</div></h1>
<p><strong>Rolling Stats</strong>: For this system, the stats are rolled differently. Roll 5d4 and re-roll any 1's. Do this 5 times and select your preferred stat and apply an automatic 18 to it.</p>
<p><strong>Attack Curve</strong>: There are three kinds of attack curves that one can choose from; low, middle, and high. These affect your base HD type, skill growth, and Saves. After selecting your attack curve then apply the Magic Growth modifiers, listed in the chart, to your HD and skills.</p>
<p><strong>Magic Growth</strong>: A character may or may not be magically inclined. Select the amount of magical ability that is best for your concept and apply an attack curve to your choice to get the foundation for your character.</p>
<p><strong>Perk</strong>: These are bonus abilities or feats gained at designated levels.</p>
<p><strong>Feat</strong>: Feats modify already present abilities, actions, skills, and so on. These are earned at first level, and every HD divisible cleanly by 3 thereafter.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Feat</strong>: These are feats on top of the feats your character gets from leveling normally. The character must still meet any prerequisites for the feat chosen.</p>
<p><strong>Ability</strong>: Thematic tricks, features, and other nifty things your character can do. Abilities are often regular use abilities that may or may not be useful in combat. They may include Spell-like abilities, sneak-attack, and other thematic things.</p>
<p><strong>Definitions</strong>: These are character-defining options that a character must choose. The first-level definitions are much more impactful than later ones. Undefined is always an option and will have bonuses of their own.</p>
<p><strong>Spells Known</strong>: In this system spells known refers to the number of spells magic users can choose to cast spontaneously. Once chosen these can only be swapped out at level-up or GM defined areas/times.</p>
<p><strong>Spells Per Day</strong>: What it says on the tin.</p>
<p><strong>Primary Mental Attribute</strong>: When creating the character choose a Mental Attribute, Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma. This will then become the Primary. Abilities, feats, and s that derive from your Mental Attribute will draw from your choice. Spell casting DCs, spell casting capability, and bonus spells will also be determined by this choice.</p>
<p><strong>Trained Skills</strong>: This is the number of skills your character can have as, "Trained Skills." This number is equal to 4 + Total Base Skill Growth + Level 1 Intelligence modifier. If your base intelligence modifier, without any magical modifiers, increases; you gain another trained skill. Other skills can be taken with story justification or by downtime in which they can justify the skill becoming trained.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus HP</strong>: Bonus is HP gained on top of Hit Dice and Constitution modifiers.</p>
<p><strong>Spell Proficiency</strong>: Spell proficiency is added to Spells, spell-like abilities(Sp), supernatural abilities(Su) DC's, as well as any non-touch attack roll. It is also applied as a flat bonus for each damage/healing/warding dice for Spells, Spell-like abilities(Sp), or Supernatural Abilities(Su). For example, if a character has a spell that deals 5d6 damage and has a Casting Proficiency of 2 it will be 5d6+10 damage.</p>
<h2 id="universal-progression"><div style="text-align:center">Universal Progression</div></h2>
<p class=tab>All characters will obtain skill points, feats, attribute score increases, and definitions as they level. They will also all have their primary and secondary skill point caps increased. Please refer to the chart below to see what your character will receive as they level.</p>

<h2 id="progressions"><div style="text-align:center">Progressions</div></h2>
<p class=tab>The four charts below are different progression choices you can select so long as your attack curve allows for it. There is Non-Magical, Basic Magic, Standard Magic, and Advanced Magic. Choose which would best suite what you have in mind for your character.</p>

<p class=tab>In these charts you will see three sub-options of, Combat Focus, Generalist, and Specialist. You will want to pick these based on how focused or thematic you want your character.</p>

<p class=tab>A combat-focused character has a lot of feat options, and this will give them a great deal of passive bonuses that make them more straight forward to use. For example, with Combat Focus it is possible to get enough feats to be a powerful weapon master that rarely misses with their weapon of choice and will have a lot of bonuses to advance combat maneuvers like grappling.</p>

<p class=tab>A specialist character will have access to lots of abilities which will give them a lot of thematic tools to use as they see fit. For example a specialist can have a breath weapon to use, access to extra dimensional storage, and project an aura that makes their enemies less effective in battle.</p>

<h2 id="magic-growth"><div style="text-align:center">Magic Growth</div></h2>
<p><strong>Non-Magical</strong>: This means typically your character will not have access to any magic themed abilities outside of "Natural Magic," but will otherwise have lots of option otherwise. Non-Magical characters gain no spell Proficiency bonuses. Gain bonus HP of 6 per HD.</p>
<p><strong>Basic Magic</strong>: This means your character has an elementary understanding of magic and will never be a master of it, but does know enough to be useful. Basic Magic characters start with 0 spell proficiency and have it increased by 1 every 10 HD to a max of 2. Gain bonus HP of 5 per HD.</p>
<p><strong>Standard Magic</strong>: This means your character has an average understanding of magic and knows enough to use even some of the more advanced types of spells out there. Standard Magic characters start with 1 spell proficiency and have it increased 1 every 8 HD to a maximum of 3. Gain bonus HP of 4 per HD.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Magic</strong>: This means the study of magic to your character is paramount and center to their lives, they will know the most advanced kind of spells.
 Advanced Magic characters start with 1 spell proficiency and have it increased 1 every 6 HD to a maximum of 4. Gain bonus HP of 3 per HD.</p>
