            <p class=tab><em>These creatures are a common denizen of the Blind and resemble floating ribbons with three red glowing eyes. They collect and amass bits and pieces of organic and inorganic matter to create a body in which they fight. The puppeteer will always float above the body it has created to control it. It uses these bodies to collect more materials to further increase the strength of their puppet. It isn't known why they do this, but they are known to attack indiscriminately. Puppeteers appear to have attack preferences and will build their puppets accordingly. If their puppet is lost it leaves them vulnerable, though they will often attack their, 'strings,' to living creatures in an attempt to save themselves.</em></p>

                A puppeteer can fire black inky threads at its foe which will burrow into their skin and take control of their muscular and skeletal system. To do this the puppeteer must succeed in dealing any damage with a ranged touch attack, see above, the target of the spell must succeed on a will save DC 23. If the subject fails they are completely controlled by the puppeteer and must make a will save on their turn every turn to break free of the control.
            </p>
            <br>
            <b>Grace</b> (Ex)<br>

            Target: Self<br>
            Duration: Instantaneous<br>
            Special: 4 Grace Points<br>
            <br>
            <p>
                Once per round, your character can spend a grace point to use an acrobatics roll instead of their AC when determining if a single incoming attack hits. It can also be used once per round to re-roll any failed reflex saves. <br>
                <br>
                <b>Special</b>: When using Grace on an incoming attack, all subsequent attacks made on the target on that turn (not round), gain an AC bonus as if defensive fighting is being used, but without the attack penalty. If your character has improved defensive fighting, it's treated as a +4 dodge bonus. Any extra bonuses from acrobatics or definitions apply as well.<br>
                <br>
                Note: This ability cannot be used if your character is flat-footed, held, or immobilized by any means. Only one grace point can be used per round.

            <b>Improved Opportunist</b><br>

            <br>
            <p>
                Attacks against a disadvantaged foe deal an extra 5d6 of the same type of damage as the base attack.
            </p>
            <br>
            <b>Leaping Assault</b> (Ex)<br>

            <br>
            <p>
                The puppeteer or puppet can attack by leaping or flying towards a foe. This action does not require a running start nor does it provoke an attack of opportunity. This action can also be used offensively. When the puppeteer or puppet lands, if there is an enemy in a threatened square, a single attack can be rolled against one of them. If this attack hits the attack will deal an extra 3d6+2.<br>
                <br>
                Note: This ability cannot be used if your character is flat-footed, held, or immobilized by any means. Only one grace point can be used per round. <br>
            </p>

            DC: 21
            <br>
            <p>
                The puppeteer's target is gripped by shadowy thorny vines that can hold them. Subjects gripped by these vines move at half speed, are considered flat footed, and take damage equal to the user's PMA modifier per square moved, including free 5 ft step actions. An affected target can spend a full round action and make a strength check, DC 15 or escape artist check DC 20 to break free. All Shadow abilities have shared uses per day.
