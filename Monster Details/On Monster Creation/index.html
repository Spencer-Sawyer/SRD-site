<h1 id="on-monster-creation">On Monster Creation</h1>
<p>While the standard character-building system can be used to make most challenges, not everyone wants a campaign filled only with mostly humanoid sapient creatures as their only combat obstacles. Below the details on how monsters, dragons, animals, constructs and so, are created.</p>
<p>All creatures are created with these base stats: 18, 16, 16, 14, 14, and 12 distributed to where it is best for the creature. These can be upgraded more to match how players grow. Instead of magical items though most creatures should have their base stats modified to match or exceed the average player's stats at that point.</p>
<h2 id="terms">Terms</h2>
<p><strong>Bonded Armor</strong>: Bonded armor is armor that simulates the stats of the kind of armor a character would wear, but is fused with the creature. This is most common in constructs, elementals, and attendants. Bonded armor cannot be looted, as it is either fused to, part of, or otherwise bonded to the creature.</p>
<p><strong>Natural Attack</strong>: Natural attacks are things like claws, fangs, wings, tails, etc. Typically a monster has a primary, often claws or a bite, that has the highest bonus. All other natural attacks are at a -5 bonus during a full round attack. On any full-round attack, a monster uses ALL of its natural attacks. If they cannot full-attack they will typically opt for their primary natural weapon. Weapon focus (Unarmed), and its counterpart feats, apply to all natural weapons.</p>
<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>
<p>Much like making a character, the first thing we need to do is pick a primary creature definition for the monster. These are not to be taken by players without a great deal of consideration by the DM first as most of these are intended to make challenging foes for equivalent level characters. Creatures can also have a series of secondary definitions. Primary definitions sometimes modify the Hit Dice type of a creature or limit the types of magical progressions it can have. </p>
