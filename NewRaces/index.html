<h1 id="races"><p style="text-align:center">Races</p></h1>
<h2 id="colibri"><p style="text-align:center">Colibri</p></h2>
<p>A small species that live primarily on the west side of the country in the planes and forests. They are often called Harvesters or Gardners as colloquial nicknames. They resemble anthropomorphic hummingbirds and are capable of extremely deft flight. Within Estrella they are food producers, both honey and fruits primarily.</p>
<p>Small-sized</p>
<p>This species lacks sexual dimorphism in height and weight</p>
<p>Males of this species are slightly more vibrant and tend to have an iridescent band of color on their wings, while the females are matte grey in the same location.</p>
<p>They average 2'9'' to 3'7'' in height and weigh between 35-70 lbs.</p>
<p><strong>Creation Information</strong></p>
<p>Attribute Modifications: -2 con, +2 Int</p>

<h2 id="crockokin"><p style="text-align:center">Crockokin</p></h2>
<p>Living in the swamps of Colomancha, and typically running sturgeon farms, the Crockokin live with their cousins the Varanakin. Despite having such a different culture from the rest of Estrella, they are fiercely loyal to the republic.</p>
<p>Medium Sized</p>
<p>This species lacks sexual dimorphism</p>
<p>Members of this species lack obvious primary and secondary sex characteristics. It is difficult to discern the sex of a Varankin without physical examination, which is considered quite rude.</p>
<p>They average 6'4' to 7'3" Weights range from 350-500 lbs, and typically are quite lithe at these weights due to high muscle density.</p>
<p><strong>Creation Information</strong></p>

<p>Natural Armor +2</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong>: Swim Speed 30 ft, gain a bonus feat at first level</p>

<h2 id="custom"><p style="text-align:center">Custom</p></h2>
<p>Always be willing to build a custom race with any player should they desire it. Typically the patterns are Ability scores +4, -2, and some sort of progression bonus. e.g. A bonus feat, bonus skill points, an extra ability, or extra definitions. Sometimes the ability scores will be less due to extra features; like flying or natural armor. Other times extra bonuses are also given, like dark vision, but this is underwhelming enough not to reduce another bonus.</p>
<h2 id="elf"><p style="text-align:center">Elf</p></h2>
<p>Elves in Estrella have a longer view of history and knowledge of the culture, rather than their fast-lived countrymen. Typically occupying positions in cultural institutions they try to guide the arts, philosophies, and principles of the country with a gentle, if not condescending, touch. Elves are very rarely found outside of cities and balk at the idea of living in planes, deserts, or mountains. </p>
<p><strong>Creation Information</strong></p>

<h2 id="goblin"><p style="text-align:center">Goblin</p></h2>
<p>Living primarily within the rim and underneath the high peaks region of Estrella, the goblins are known to be isolationist from the rest of the Estrella citizenry, primarily due to a proclivity for living underground and within cave systems. The grand majority of technological development in the past century has stemmed out of the goblin cities found within The Rim. They are a matriarchal society, sort of. The region is run democratically and does send representatives to the Estrella senate. These tend to be highly astute females, as their culture tends to value beautiful goblins over all else. As the saying goes, "Goblin men think with the wrong head." </p>
<p><strong>Creation Information</strong></p>
<p>Small Sized</p>
<p>Heights range from 3’ to 3'8" examples beyond either threshold are very rare</p>

<h2 id="ha-seht"><p style="text-align:center">Ha-seht</p></h2>
<p>A canid species found primarily in the Salt of the country. They have short black, or gold, fur, wiry bodies, tall and pointed ears. They are most known for their strong proclivity for success in business as well as vicious family feuds.

<p><img alt="alt_text" src="../images/image2.png" title="image_tooltip" /></p>
<h2 id="hawk-fairy"><p style="text-align:center">Hawk Fairy</p></h2>
<p>A solitary species that typically leave their young in the care of other species. In spite of this they almost always end up behaving like a Hawk Fairy and nothing like they were raised like. When they grow up they often live among the Colibri or anywhere in the wilds. They are fervent survivalists typically, though some do end up living in cities. They are friendly, but not peaceful if forced to defend themselves.</p>

<h2 id="kobold"><p style="text-align:center">Kobold</p></h2>
<p>A small reptilian species that live within The Rim and high peaks of the country, typically without interfering with the goblins there. The kobolds, while they do pay their taxes, do not consider themselves part of Estrella, but rather servants and extensions of their matron, or patron, dragon.
