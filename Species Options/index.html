      Always be willing to build a custom species with any player should they desire it. Typically the patterns are Ability scores +4, -2, and some sort of progression bonus. e.g. A bonus feat, bonus skill points, an extra ability, or extra definitions. Sometimes the ability scores will be less due to extra features; like flying or natural armor. Other times extra bonuses are also given, like dark vision, but this is underwhelming enough not to reduce another bonus.

         Elves in Estrella have a longer view of history and knowledge of the culture, rather than their fast-lived countrymen. Typically occupying positions in cultural institutions they try to guide the arts, philosophies, and principles of the country with a gentle, if not condescending, touch. Elves are very rarely found outside of cities and balk at the idea of living in planes, deserts, or mountains.

         Living primarily within the rim and underneath the high peaks region of Estrella, the goblins are known to be isolationist from the rest of the Estrella citizenry, primarily due to a proclivity for living underground and within cave systems. The grand majority of technological development in the past century has stemmed out of the goblin cities found within The Rim. They are a matriarchal society, sort of. The region is run democratically and does send representatives to the Estrella senate. These tend to be highly astute females, as their culture tends to value beautiful goblins over all else. As the saying goes, "Goblin men think with the wrong head."

         Living primarily in Sierra Hielo these are a set of elves with feathered wings, predatory tendencies, and a xenophobic behavior that puts their low-land cousins to shame. Unlike city elves, winged elves tend to be more proactive in building and putting the work in on their infrastructure. They don't prefer a life of opulence, but a life of traceable achievements. Often times they are completely carnivorous and do not eat any vegetables, fruits, or grains. Their xenophobia takes the form of low-expectations in other species. Their skin tones tend to be light and range from white to pale blues, greys, and purples. They are, unfortunately, not as nimble as their terrestrial cousins, but just as frail.<br>
