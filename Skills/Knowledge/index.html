    <h1 id="knowledge">Knowledge</h1>
<p class=tab>
Most characters are more than just walking combat machines that know nothing of the world. Many characters will have knowledge that can and will assist them in their endeavors. Rolling a knowledge skill will be against preset DCs by the DM. There are many knowledge skills and they will be detailed below.
</p>

<h2 id="arcane">Arcane</h2>
<p class=tab>
Knowledge of the magical world related to the mystical arts practiced by individuals who do not draw their power from nature or the gods. Examples of this use would be identifying spells, identifying magical items, knowledge of most aberration, constructs, and mythical creatures, and anything else that feels sufficiently magic-y
</p>

<h2 id="common">Common</h2>
<p class=tab>
Local legends, the local foods, important laws, the atmosphere of a city, and anything someone might call, 'street knowledge,' in another time and place. This will be used. Common will not provide anything more than cursory information on high class celebrities and politics.
</p>

<h2 id="high-class">High Class</h2>
<p class=tab>
Knowing who is in power, who is famous, who has sway in the political structure of an area. Anyone with a big reputation in the world is covered by this as well, but your character will know a great deal of detail about them. This also covers less commonly known laws and the political structure/situation of a place as well.
</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p class=tab>
With knowledge of the past you can help know what to do in the future. Historical knowledge will help identify artifacts of all kinds, magical to mundane. It will give insight on the use of old ruins, cultures, and cities. It can also assist in the appraisal of items. This can help identify some mythical creatures and a great deal of dragons.
</p>

<h2 id="nature">Nature</h2>
<p class=tab>
The natural world is filled with many wonders. Those who know nature will be able to easily identify animals and aberrations. On top of this they will more readily know which plants are which, which rocks are strong enough to climb, and many other useful things.
</p>

<h2 id="the-planes">The Planes</h2>
<p class=tab>
There is more to the world than just the prime material plane. The many overlay planes of the elements and gods all have their own rules and denizens. This knowledge will help identify elementals and non-fey attendants.
</p>

<h2 id="religion">Religion</h2>
<p class=tab>
Religion is a major part of any world and there are a lot of people with a great deal of knowledge of their structures, beliefs, rituals, and holidays. Those with this skill can identify demonic and angelic attendants as well as undead.
