<p class=tab>
There are many skills that can entertain for money, or offer other kinds of benefits, such as inspiring your group. With performance there are many options that can be put in here, below will be a list of rather standard ones and potential synergies with them. If used to make money a performance takes at least 1 hour and money earned is dependent on the outcome. The core DC should be set by the DM based on the location and setting in which the character is attempting it. Of course a DM should consider the venue and any potential booking costs and such in the process.
