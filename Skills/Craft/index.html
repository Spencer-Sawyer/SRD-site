<h1 id="crafting">Crafting</h1>
<p class=tab>
Crafting is not a simple skill with basic functionality, there are many different types of crafts out there that have wide ranging affects and implications. Several types of crafting are available by default, but this is by no means an exhaustive list. Specific rules are created for the basic examples, though any DM should be willing to design and work on a crafting skill for their players.
</p>

<h2 id="alchemy">Alchemy</h2>
<p style=tab>
Alchemy is the term for any kind of crafting that involves chemicals. If in use with a more modern or contemporary understanding of things it can be called Chemistry as well. A crafting roll is used to make and determine the quality of what is created. Spell casters using this crafting can also turn their spells into potions so long as they have a full alchemy kit. If a DC is failed the materials in the kit are wasted. If the DC is failed by more than 10 the substance affects the crafter. See the chart below for some suggested DCs and methods for this. 
</p>
<p class=tab>
Field alchemy kits only have enough ingredients for 5 potions and without proper survival or knowledge (nature) rolls, they cannot be filled out of a city. Field Alchemy kits costs 35 gp and weight 15 lbs; restock is 15gp. They contain small mixing vials, flasks, burners, and other useful tools. Fixed, or permanent, alchemy benches have enough to make 25 potions when fully stocked but weight well over 100 lbs and are too unwieldy to carry around.  It built properly they could fit on a cart. The general cost of a fixed alchemy kit is 500 gp, and restocking a fixed alchemy bench costs 150 gp.
