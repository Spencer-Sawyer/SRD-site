# Profession
<p class=tab>
A character isn't always just an adventurer, lest being a mercenary is their only goal. Many will have a side profession or even main profession they are good at. These professions can have many, many uses and should be utilized by a DM to a good end. There are a lot of skills that pair with a profession, in which case the profession check should be used and the DC should be reduced by 5. The amount of professions is legion, so I will only list a few as examples and how they could be used.

## Locksmith
<p Class=tab>
You are skilled not just in lock picking but the assembly, repair, and manufacturing of locks as a whole. Picking a lock to you is a request from a customer or a government worker. Your locks are also legendary. With the use of a Tinker's work bench you can create locks of a DC equal to your Profession check when rolling. This skill will also grant a +2 synergy bonus to lock picking with 6 or more skill points in it. This skill can be used in place of a lock picking check, whatever the DC of the check was it will be reduced by 5.
