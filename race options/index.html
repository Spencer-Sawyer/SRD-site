<p>Race/Species is one of the root choices for a character build and can, in some cases, be one of the most important to how a character is built. With that in mind there are several dozen ways to go about it. It can be purely cosmetic where there are no differences in race/species, it could be mild balanced statistical redistribution, or there could be level adjustments applied and imbalanced statistical distribution applied. With that said it boils down to what the game master would think is most applicable to the world they are building. Whether they go with an entirely constructionist view--where all race/species are balanced, complete essentialist--where the differences are sharp and clearly measurable, or go somewhere in the middle. It is important that the game master be consistent in the choice here though. The examples below will be separated into Mixed, or Essentialist categories. Constructionist will be explained as a rule that applies to all race/species.</p>
<p>Terms</p>
<p>Hit Dice - Another name for level.</p>
<p>Level Gap Increase - This is a rule that applies when a race/species has imbalanced stats/abilities. It will increase the experience required by the equivalent level total. For example — It normally takes 1,000 experience to go from level 1 to level 2. If a race/species has a gap of +1 it will add the required experience to go from level 2 to level 3 to the gap between level 1 and level 2. So in total it would take 3,000 experience to go from level 1 to level 2 instead of 1,000.</p>
<p>Effective Hit Dice - This is the level gap + the character’s Hit Die. This is what is used to determine challenge, experience, rewards, and so on. Always use the effective hit dice of the character.</p>
<p><strong>Constructionist </strong>- This rule set will only apply the most extreme race/specie differences. Such as size category, number of limbs, and other plainly obvious things. Otherwise anything under this system gets +4 skill points at first level and +1 skill point every level thereafter, and a bonus feat.</p>
<p><strong>Mixed </strong>- This is a rule set where the physical aspects of the race is inherent, but there are no natural inclinations for behavior, skills, feats, or abilities. There will be attribute balances and uneven ones. Level Gaps do exist in this category but, tend to be low.</p>
<p><strong>Essentialist </strong>- This rule set is where there are sharp and obvious strength and power differences between races/species. Here you will see strongly suggested alignments. Skill Bonuses, abilities, and often more extreme imbalances in attributes. Often time Level Gaps are higher here than their Mixed example counterparts.</p>
<p>Size - the size category of the creature. Small sized are weaker and will off set imbalanced attribute distributions. Large size creatures would inherently gain a level gap due to the benefits of being large. See Size Categories for what this effects.</p>
<p>Examples</p>
<h2 id="goblin">Goblin</h2>
<p>A short species with a reputation for being unorganized, dirty, and violent. Their skin tones range from dark brown, orange, grey, or green. While the reputation can be unfounded among some tribes, it isn’t among others. Goblins have broad pointy ears, they are a cousin species to elves, though notably shorter. Highly tribal, they divide themselves among clans. Their societal structure tends to be based on who is the strongest/most violent and can hold power over the weaker members of the tribe. Others are more political and organized with a clear system of power, class, and all the whistles and bells of a functioning society. It is no mystery which of these two types live among other sapient species and which doesn’t.</p>
<p>Small Sized</p>
<p>Heights range from 3’ to 3'8" examples beyond either threshold are very rare</p>
<p>Weight varies a bit more depending on body build. This can range from 30-80 lbs</p>
<p><strong>Mixed</strong></p>
<p>Attribute Modifications: -2 Strength, +2 Dex, and +2 Intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>Goblin Guile</strong>: Pick two skills and add a +2 species bonus to them, these will increase for every 3 HD.</p>
<p><strong>Essentialist</strong></p>
<p>Level Gap: +1</p>
<p>Attribute Modifications: -2 Strength, +2 Dex, and +4 Intelligence.</p>
<p>Gain Mechanist Familiar as an ability.</p>
<p>+2 to Search, +2 to Disable Device, these will increase by +1 every for every 3 hit dice.</p>
<p>Alignment: Neutral Any, they have a semi-lax view on law. Morality is determined by tribe.</p>
<h2 id="human">Human</h2>
<p>A ubiquitous species known for their charisma and leadership skills. Strong warriors within the species aren’t unheard of, they tend to focus more on strategy, politics, and fame rather than being a warrior species. Like Leonal, due to their shorter lifespan they breed more often. This is why they have large numbers and are so common compared to longer lived species, such as elves and dwarves.</p>

<p>Attribute Modification: -2 Wisdom, +2 Intelligence, +4 Charisma</p>
<p>Gain Leadership as an ability</p>
<p>+2 to Bluff, +2 to diplomacy, these will increase by 1 for every 3 hit dice.</p>
<p>Alignment: Any</p>
