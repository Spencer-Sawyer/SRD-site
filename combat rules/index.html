<h1 id="combat">Combat</h1>
<h2 id="a-turn">A Turn</h2>
<p>TL;DR - one Move action and one Standard action, or one full-round action per turn*</p>
<pre><code>During a turn, you can take a Move Action and a Standard Action normally. Alternatively, instead of making a move and a standard action, a Full Round action can be taken. At any time during your round, you can take any number of free actions, but no two of the same. Some abilities and spells are a swift action; only one of these can be taken during your turn.

**Standard Actions **- Typically the focus of your turn's action

    _Attacking Once_
</code></pre>
<p>_       Casting a spell with "Standard" as cast time_</p>
<p>_       Throwing an object_</p>
<p>_       Lighting a Torch_   </p>
<pre><code>    _Initiating a grapple_

**Move Actions **- Things that help you achieve the focus of your turns action

    _Moving up to your base movement speed_
</code></pre>
<p>_       Drawing a weapon without moving during the round_</p>
<p>_       Retrieving a less-than convenient item that is stored on your person_</p>
<p>_   <strong>Swift Actions </strong>_- Actions that require little thought or are lumped in with a greater action</p>
<pre><code>    _Drawing a weapon while moving_
</code></pre>
<p>_       Drinking a potion drawn from a belt hoop_</p>
<p>_       Non-offensively throwing a torch while moving_</p>
<p>_   <strong>Free Actions</strong>_ - Small actions that done as part of any action</p>
<pre><code>    _Speaking_
</code></pre>
<p>_       A 5-foot step during a full-round action_</p>
<p>_       Drawing an item from a handy haversack_</p>
<p>_       Drawing an item from a conveniently stored location, such as a potion belt hoop_</p>
<p>_       Dropping a held object_</p>
<p>_   <strong>Full Round Actions </strong>_- These actions take up the whole round; some are subdivided into other actions</p>
<pre><code>    _A Full-Round Attack using all of your base attack bonuses_
</code></pre>
<p>_           You get as many attacks as your base attack allows - See details below_</p>
<p>_       A Full Round Spell casting action_</p>
<p>_       Total Defense_</p>
<p>_       A Charge Attack_</p>
<p>_       A Bull Rush _</p>
<p>_       A Overrun attempt_</p>
<h1 id="attacks">Attacks</h1>
<h2 id="special-attacks">Special Attacks</h2>
<pre><code>**Trip Attack**:


Step 1: To start a trip attack, make a melee touch-attack against your target. Your target will get an opportunity attack on you. If the opportunity attack connects, the attempt fails.


Step 2: Make opposed rolls using 1d20 + Str (Or Dex if higher) + Size Modifier + Any other bonuses to Trip. If the initiator wins, their target will fall prone. Vice Versa, if the defender wins, the trip attempt fails, and a counter opposed roll can be attempted immediately.


**Disarm Attack**:


    Step 1: On first attempting a disarm, your opponent gets an opportunity attack on you. If this connects, your attempt fails.


    Step 2: Make opposed attack rolls with your opponent. There is a +4 bonus for using a two-handed weapon. If your attacker is one size category smaller, they get a -4, and you will get as +4, and vice versa. If the gap in size is larger, it is another -4 or +4 for each category difference.


    Step 3: If you beat your opponent's attack roll you have left them disarmed. If you were unarmed when you attempted this, you would take their weapon instead.


**Sundering Attack**:


    Step 1: On first attempting to sunder, your opponent gets an opportunity attack on you. If this connects, your attempt fails.


    Step 2: Make opposed attack rolls with your opponent. There is a +4 bonus for using a two-handed weapon. If your attacker is one size category smaller, they get a -4, and you will get as +4, and vice versa. If the gap in size is larger, it is another -4 or +4 for each category difference.


    Step 3: If you beat your opponent's attack roll you will damage their weapon, armor, or shield directly and not to them.
</code></pre>
<h2 id="full-round-attacks">Full Round Attacks</h2>
<p>A Full-Round attack can typically have up to 4 attacks, though more are possible, which can also be used to perform some special attacks. If a special attack is labeled as an attack, it can be substituted in place of a normal attack. For example, if you have +20/+15/+10/+5, that means you have four attacks during a Full-Round attack. Instead of just attacking four times, you can instead Trip on the first one and make three normal attacks or a disarm on the third rather than a normal attack. If any special attack, such as a trip or a disarm fails, you will lose your subsequent attacks. As a note, some feats modify special attacks. The Improved Trip feat, for example, turns a successful trip attempt into a free action, but only if it succeeds.</p>
