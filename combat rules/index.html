<h1 id="combat">Combat</h1>
<p>Combat is when physical altercations need to be resolved. This is done through a turn based system in which dice are rolled to determine the outcome of such a conflict. The following rules will explain how to do this and all the nuance involved.</p>
<h2 id="initiative-roll">Initiative Roll</h2>
<p>Start combat with an initiative roll. This should be done by rolling 1d20 and adding your character's initiative bonus to the roll. </p>
<p>If there is a conflict of two rolls being the same, have the conflicting characters roll against eachother and arrange them by high to low before slotting them into your initiative order.</p>
<p><em>As a suggested rule, divide your bonus by 100 and add it to the end as a decimal to help reduce the amount of initiative conflicts. Example: 1d20+8 with a roll of 12 would be 20.08</em></p>
<h2 id="combat-round">Combat Round</h2>
<p>A combat round is when all of the turns have been taken and the current initiative order is back at the top. The duration of a combat round is approximately 6 seconds.</p>
<h2 id="turn-and-actions">Turn and Actions</h2>
<p>A character's turn is broken down into action types, things here can get a bit granular. Primarily a turn is broken into a move action, a standard action, free actions, and a swift action should they have any. A standard action can instead be replaced with a character's attack action(s).</p>
<h3 id="move-action">Move Action</h3>
<p>A move action is typically limited to readying a weapon, moving up to your character's movement. Most move actions provoke attacks of opportunity, a feature explained later.</p>
<p>In place of a move action a <em>five-foot step</em> can be taken in its place, which provokes no attacks of opportunity.</p>
<h3 id="standard-action">Standard Action</h3>
<p>A standard action is something that takes more thought and energy, such as lighting a lantern, casting a spell, using abilities, and so on. If something is labeled as a standard action, it takes the entire standard action to do it.</p>
<p>In place of standard actions a character can instead take all of its attack actions. Most characters start with one attack action, though as their base attack bonus increases the number of attack actions will increase. This will be denoted in the attack curve chart as +x/+y/+z... when there is a slash and a number that tells you the base attack bonus used with that attack. If your character has three attacks, they can get three attack actions in a round. </p>
<p><em>Please note if attack actions are used, no standard actions can be taken.</em></p>
<h3 id="free-action">Free Action</h3>
<p>A free action is something that can be done with little to no thought and at the same time as other actions. This would include speaking, grabbing something from a readily available place on the character's person, drawing a weapon while moving, and whatever else might fit. No two free actions can be the same action, but a character is allowed as many free actions as they can use.</p>
<h3 id="swift-action">Swift Action</h3>
<p>A swift action, sometimes called a bonus action, are actions that can occur with everthing else happening. These are often spells or abilities, rarely any kind of physical or martial combat maneuver. If a spell or ability is labled as a swift action, it is one. A character can only use a single swift action per round.</p>
<h3 id="full-round-action">Full Round Action</h3>
<p>A full round action takes the entire round, so it begins on a characters turn, and ends at the beginning of the next character's turn. This means the character on the following term can act normally again. No move, swift, standard or immediate actions can take place during a Full Round Action. Often times these are slow casting spells, such as summons, or slow to execute abilities.</p>
<h3 id="immediate-action">Immediate Action</h3>
<p>The rarest kind of action is an immediate action, sometimes called a reaction. These actions can be used at any point during a round by a character. A character can only use one immediate action per round.</p>
<h2 id="move-actions">Move Actions</h2>
<p><strong>Moving</strong>: Moving up to character's movement is considered a move action. When moving out of a threatened square, this provokes an attack of opportunity. </p>
<p><strong>Item Retrieval</strong>: Getting an item from a well-organized bag is a move action and provokes an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Activating Motion based items</strong>: Items that require it be moved or twisted or otherwise manipulated in less than a button or command word, are move actions. This would be something like a Rod of Sealing, where the rod has to be moved in a square around the target. This provokes an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Drawing a weapon</strong>: When drawing a weapon during movement is not specified, or the character is standing still, it is a move action. This provokes an attack of opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Standing/Dropping</strong>: Standing up or dropping to prone is a movement action. This provokes an attack of opportunity.</p>
