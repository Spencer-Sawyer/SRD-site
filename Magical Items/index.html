<h1 id="magical-items">Magical Items</h1>
<p class=tab> 
Magical items are the second half of a character. Every encounter in the examples are built with a character having their level's gold worth of magical items.  A character without their tools is vulnerable, especially at higher levels.</P>

<h2 id="imbuements">Imbuements</h2>
<p class=tab>
Imbuements are special traits, features, protections, or otherwise useful things an armor, shield, or weapon can do. Imbuements are limited by the enhancement modifier of the item. An Arming Sword +1 has one imbuement capacity. Meanwhile an Arming Sword +5 has five imbuement capacity . An imbuement is permanent and cannot be undone.</P>

<p><em>Alternative: If it is desired that imbuements be removable. They can be explained as runes, gems, or some other thing that is attached to an item. The imbuement would follow the rune or gem instead of being permanently stuck to a weapon</em>  </p>
<p><strong>Minor Imbuements</strong>: These are very weak affects that take 0 capacity, but limited to one per item. These can be applied to any masterwork   </p>
<p><strong>Lesser Imbuements</strong>: The first lesser imbuement takes one capacity. The second and onward take up two capacity.   </p>
<p><strong>Moderate Imbuement</strong>: The first moderate imbuement takes up two capacity. The second and onward take up three capacity.   </p>
<p><strong>Greater Imbuement</strong>: These take four capacity.</p>
<h2 id="armorshield-enhancement-costs">Armor/Shield Enhancement Costs</h2>
<p class=tab>
Armor enhancement is a bonus that increases the armor's hardness, hit points, and armor enhancement bonus. The price of this is determined by squaring the bonus and multiplying by two hundred. (Bonus<sup>2</sup> x 200) Every enhancement bonus increases the hardness of an armor by 2 and the HP of the armor by 10. Enhancement costs for shields are the same, as are the hardness and HP bonuses.</p>
